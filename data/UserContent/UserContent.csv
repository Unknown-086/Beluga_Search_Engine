Russian aggression in Georgia and Ukraine demonstrated the failure of EU’s policy regarding its eastern neighborhood. This policy was based on the arrangement of so-called “ buffer zones” of friendly states, without hindering Russia’s core interests explicitly. Expansion without enlargement has shown that such a strategy can neither satisfy the geopolitical goals of the EU, nor ensure the security of the Union. The bloc cannot rely solely on its soft and transformative power. Therefore, the EU is likely to return to its strongest geopolitical tool – enlargement. Though, before Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the issue of granting candidate status to any country of the Associated Trio (Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) was not being discussed, let alone the prospects of a new wave of EU enlargement. Rethinking the EU Policy Towards Eastern Partnership Countries Source: EURACTIV. Photo by Olivier Hoslet/EPA-EFE For quite a long time, Eastern European countries, such as Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia have been developing their cooperation with the EU in the framework of Eastern Partnership. The EU and these countries managed to sign Association Agreements and established the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas . These efforts are aimed at internal transformations of EU neighbors that will allow them to fulfill criteria for potential membership in the Union. Nevertheless, there was relatively limited engagement between the EU and these countries, owing partly to Russia’s claim to “privileged spheres of interest” in the post-Soviet space and also to the lack of the EU’s strategic vision. Consequently, the EU’s goals in this region are unclear as there are no consistent policy in this respect, and one could hardly predict what the EU was intending to do. This begs the question of whether the EU is planning to challenge Russia directly to retake the initiative in this region by acceleration of the integration of Ukraine and Moldova into the bloc or will Brussels keep maintaining the status quo and sticking to the “buffer zone” approach? Anyway, the Post-Soviet space will remain an area of geopolitical contestation between the European Union and Russia. Russia’s military involvement in Georgia in 2008 and invasion of Ukraine in 2014 have further raised questions about whether the EU is ready to respond firmly in order to strengthen its own influence in these countries. It turned out that in 2014 Russia was ready to use force in order to preserve control over its sphere of “vital interests” while the EU was, to a large extent, divided in its response to Russia. A new critical challenge that the EU faces is Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which requires the unified position of all member states. Ukraine applied for EU membership during the first days of Russia’s large-scale invasion and other countries of the Associated Trio, Georgia and Moldova, did the same . The context of the Russo-Ukrainian War revitalized the EU’s enlargement agenda. However, before the EU Commission issued its recommendation to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova, certain member states were pushing for the establishment of a framework that would include EU neighbors. For instance, Emmanuel Macron suggested to create a “European Political Community,” which would be a club of the EU member states, its neighbors and non-EU members. The neighbors of the EU opposed this initiative because they thought it would serve as a substitute for candidate status and EU membership. EU leaders responded to the pressure by reassuring that the platform was not intended to serve as an alternative to EU membership. The goal is to strengthen political dialogue and cooperation, particularly in the area of international security. The EU has decided to act after almost a decade of ambiguous policies towards Eastern European countries. Earlier, the EU stuck to the so-called “Open Doors Policy” and avoided any concrete statements on potential membership of these countries. Without exaggeration, the EU has taken a serious decision to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova. It also promised the same status for Georgia when it fulfills all the necessary preconditions. One of them is strengthening Georgia’s political institutions, which seem fairly fragile. There are also accusations of fraud, intimidation, vote-buying, cronyism and police harassment in Georgia. Also, the EU is concerned about civil liberties, the influence of oligarchs on politics and the freedom of the media. It is therefore necessary to understand why this decision was made and what the consequences are for both the EU and these countries. The EU’s Profile: Commitment to Defend Human Rights and Democracy First of all, this decision was made in order to send a signal to Russia, as it means that the EU recognizes Ukraine and Moldova to be a part of the European family , not a distant relative as Moscow would want. Practically, the EU is shifting from its inconsistent stance on the integration of the Associated Trio countries and conveying a clear message that they will never be part of Russia. By sending this signal, the EU is stating that it is ready to support Ukraine in its efforts to counter Russian aggression and to protect the core values of a rules-based international order. By sending this signal, the EU is stating that it is ready to support Ukraine in its efforts to counter Russian aggression and to protect the core values of a rules-based international order. By granting candidate status to Moldova, the EU reaffirmed its commitment to support Chisinau considering the background of Russia’s actions in Ukraine. This is especially relevant because of the occupied territory of Transnistria, where according to various sources some 2000 military personnel of the Russian Federation are present. Concerns over Transnistria were also expressed in the MEPs statements , where they stressed the serious provocations and security incidents in Moldova. As a result, the EU pledged to support these countries as much as needed, making this the strongest response to Russian actions since 2008. As a result, the EU pledged to support these countries as much as needed, making this the strongest response to Russian actions since 2008 by imposing unprecedented sanctions and pressure on Putin, freezing Russian assets and providing military assistance to Ukraine. As the Ukrainian people demonstrated their willingness to fight for the free and democratic future of their state, the EU cannot remain silent. The role of the core values the EU is pursuing and their impact on decision-making cannot be overestimated in its relations with any country, considering the EU’s strong profile in democracy promotion, protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In this context, it is worth mentioning the visit of Olaf Scholz, Emmanuel Macron, Mario Draghi and Klaus Iohannis to Ukraine on 16th of June. They were able to see with their own eyes the consequences of Russia’s invasion on the liberated areas of the Kyiv region. It is likely that the EU leaders in Irpin, Ukraine felt the atrocities and human rights violations committed by Russia, which could have influenced their positions in favor of granting candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova. Source: AP News. Photo by Ludovic Marin The Role of Public Opinion and Pressure on the EU Member States Along with the need to send a signal to Russia, the EU’s commitment to democracy and preserving human rights, there is another critical aspect that could shape the EU’s decision – public opinion within the Union. It was not just the EU leaders who saw the evidence of war crimes committed in Ukraine. The public support increased after the EU leaders visited liberated Irpin in the Kyiv region. Even before the trip of the European politicians to Kyiv, the whole world, and the citizens of the EU, were shocked by the photos shared on the Internet that showed hundreds of innocent civilians that were tortured and killed. In this respect, it is noteworthy to mention the survey conducted among EU citizens by Eurobarometer in April 2022 . As a whole, Europeans are of the opinion that the EU has been strong (79%) and united (63%) as well as quick (58%) in responding to the war. Most respondents embrace unwavering support for Ukraine as 80% approve the financial support provided to Ukraine and 66% agree that “Ukraine should join the EU when it is ready.” In addition, 71% believe that Ukraine is part of the European family and 89% feel sympathy towards Ukrainians. In April the level of public support for Ukraine’s integration into the EU was probably at its highest. Such strong support could be a result of popular outcry regarding Russia’s actions and a widespread sympathy towards Ukrainians. The EU’s decision of granting candidate status could also be driven by the significant pressure of public opinion. The creative strategy of Volodymyr Zelenskyy should also be mentioned as his approach has thus far been on delivering online speeches to the parliaments of various countries, including those of EU member states. In his appeals, he emphasized the need for Ukraine’s fast-track membership in the EU and the granting of candidate status as a first step towards it. Towards Greater Europe: von der Leyen’s “Geopolitical Commission” and Support of the EU Institutions It is pertinent to note the commitment of top EU politicians to this decision as they are the ones who were most active in pushing the agenda and course of action that was being taken by the EU. First of all, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, played a major role. Ukrainians are ready to die for the European perspective. We want them to live with us the European dream European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, Source: Deutsche Welle June 17, 2022 The European Commission has always been a key institution of the EU that drives major changes and policies of the Union. Von der Leyen’s ambitions to increase the EU’s role on the international stage can also be explained by her strong position with regard to granting candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova. Furthermore, it is also consistent with the remarks she made after being appointed European Commission President that instead of a “political Commission” as Junker had, von der Leyen will lead a “geopolitical Commission.” Such a take on the EU’s global role has a direct influence on the EU’s Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, as well as the EU’s Neighborhood Policy and Enlargement. Von der Leyen’s desire to strengthen the EU’s geopolitical standing clash with Russia’s claims over countries that Moscow believes to be its “near abroad.” And it was not only von der Leyen who supported the EU’s decision. President of the European Council, Charles Michel, was also supportive in his speeches regarding granting candidate status. For instance, he mentioned that this is going to be an unprecedented event in European history with the EU making such a strong geopolitical move in order to strengthen security and stability across the continent. In addition, Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament, urged the EU to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova in response to the autocratic threat . This shows that the EU’s main institutions, the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament, have backed this critical step. As opposed to 2014, the EU is now willing to demonstrate its ability to carry out proactive policy towards its eastern neighborhood. A key question is whether the EU will be unified enough and able to find the “power” it needs to project its influence on Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. Specifically, it raises doubts considering the internal crises that the EU faces right now with regard to energy crisis , Brexit outcomes , and democracy backsliding in certain member states . Furthermore, the decision to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova was made against the backdrop of rising tensions between the U.S. and China . Candidate status for Ukraine and Moldova can be regarded as the EU’s attempt of achieving strategic autonomy in the context of a fragmented international order and geopolitical contest between major powers, by strengthening its eastern flank. Such move can be regarded as a geopolitical maneuver that would help the EU to expand its influence and enhance its position in the international system. Advocacy of Integration Processes by Poland and Baltic States Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia could have a major impact on the EU decision as the countries are often referred to as the “New Europe” which tend to position themselves as supporters of European integration. Their position can be explained by the rooted perceptions of Russian menace that these countries are facing because of the close geographical proximity of Russia’s borders. Moreover, besides the constant threats coming from Russia, these states are also exposed to the harmful actions of Belarus and its autocratic regime. A case in point is the recent artificial border crisis, which might be viewed as a hybrid tool used to threaten Poland, the Baltic states, and the EU in general. Overall, EU enlargement has been a key topic on the agenda of these countries in order to boost stability and security on their borders. Not to mention Poland’s role in creating the Eastern Partnership to bring eastern neighbors closer to the EU. Source: president.gov.ua In a practical sense, before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine started, Polish President Andrzej Duda and President of Lithuania Gitanas Nauseda visited Kyiv to deliver the message that their countries will do everything in their power to ensure that Ukraine receives candidate status. In addition, the Polish president paid a few visits to some European capitals in order to persuade member states that were hesitant about granting candidate status. Financial background of the EU decision, Ukraine’s Post-War Reconstruction and support of Moldova Another significant factor that impacted the EU’s decision was the necessity to provide increased economic support and investments for Ukraine and Moldova. Providing additional funding to Ukraine and Moldova not only facilitates reforms bu t is also considered essential to minimizing the negative impact of the Russian invasion. A candidate state of the EU is entitled to additional financial and institutional assistance through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) . A basic purpose of the IPA is to speed up the transfers of EU funds, which in turns ensures reform stability. Moreover, considering the fact that Ukraine’s economy and infrastructure are severely damaged as a result of ongoing aggression, candidate status was thought to be an effective step to support Ukraine’s economic and financial sectors, as well as to help rebuild the country after the war is over. Candidate status, in turn, is seen as helpful in attracting more investments , which the country urgently needs now. For Moldova, the aftershocks of the war also caused immense damage to various sectors of its economy. Candidacy, therefore, could be viewed as a vital step in supporting the fragile economy of Moldova by utilizing the IPA and unblocking additional sources of financial assistance to Chisnau. There is not a single social or economic area that would not be affected by the war. Rising prices for oil products and natural gas, difficulties with the export of agricultural products, the closure of trade routes are the consequences of the war. Maia Sandu, June 24, 2022. Source: Info Tag What Is Next : Fast-Track Membership for Kyiv and Chisinau or a “Balkan Trap”? Upon the EU’s decision to grant candidate status, the speed of the integration process will depend on how successfully Ukraine and Moldova implement necessary reforms and carry out internal transformations in order to move to the next stage – opening of the accession talks. Nevertheless, the ball is not only in Ukraine’s or Moldova’s court, as much will also depend on the consensus and readiness of the EU to go further. In a nutshell, the political will of the EU member states is going to be a decisive factor for the possibility of fast-tracking membership to Ukraine and Moldova. Indeed, these factors raise the question of whether the EU will be able to absorb new members in the near future. That is why many Ukrainian and Moldovan experts are afraid of falling into the so-called “Balkan trap.” Source: European Union Before giving candidate status, international experts, politicians, and diplomats were worried about the differentiation of the enlargement process. This is in light of the fact that Western Balkan countries have not yet achieved success in their integration into the EU despite receiving the same status. The fact that any country can veto the EU decision to open accession talks makes the process time consuming, as it was in the case of Bulgaria’s veto regarding North Macedonia . The experiences of North Macedonia and other states indicate that the issue of the EU’s readiness to accept new members is truly critical. In the short-term, candidate status is not a panacea, because accession talks can begin in 10 years or so. One needs to remember that candidate status does not guarantee accession. To a large extent, the European integration of Ukraine and Moldova will depend on the success of the Western Balkans as these two processes seem to be intertwined. For instance, Olaf Scholz was talking about the possibility of the accession of the Western Balkans and other candidates, including Ukraine and Moldova. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was skeptical even about candidate status for Ukraine and Moldova. Furthermore, Rutte was saying that granting this status would be “unfair” with regard to Balkan states who have been waiting for such a status much longer. Another key factor that might be a problem when taking into account the experience of the Western Balkans is the size of territory. As far as the EU is not ready to integrate small countries such as Montenegro, Albania and Northern Macedonia, integration of bigger states seems to be complicated indeed . When it comes to Ukraine, for example, the process can be difficult indeed as it will require additional reforms within the EU that can take time. Hence, fast-track membership for Ukraine and Moldova is difficult to imagine in the short term. In the end, it is the progress in reforms by Kyiv and Chisnau and the political will of member states that are going to be decisive factors for the future enlargement. Despite this, the EU’s decision seems to be more than just a political gesture. Related Author: Vitalii Rishko Vitalii is a Content Writer for EU affairs at TNGO.

Source : John Thys/AFP/Getty Images Ukraine’s potential EU membership brings a range of significant challenges and opportunities. If admitted, Ukraine would be the EU’s largest country by landmass and would rival Poland in population. However, the ongoing war struck a blow to Ukraine’s GDP, necessitating an examination of the Copenhagen criteria, or the benchmarks for assessing a nation’s progress in terms of governance reforms that adhere to European norms. Ukraine, despite its proclaimed aspirations of liberal democratic governance, still has to implement many reforms to align with the EU. While the Republic of Ukraine was granted potential membership status in the EU on the 23 rd of June, 2022, stakeholders discussed the country’s accession well before that. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine has tried to navigate between its eastern and western neighbors. Formal relations between the EU and Ukraine started with the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) in 1994, an economic cooperation agreement that “[didn’t] provide for integration of Ukraine with the EU but establish[ed] a framework for cooperation and the coordination of certain policies” (Spiliopoulos, 2014). President Yanukovych’s removal from power after blocking a trade agreement marked a watershed moment in European power dynamics: Russia feared that Ukraine’s shift out of its sphere of influence would undermine its security. Following the 2004 Orange Revolution and Viktor Yushchenko’s rise to power, the EU-Ukraine relation strengthened with the Eastern Partnership in 2008. “The Eastern Partnership is an answer to the call of the neighbouring countries in the east of EU; that call would be to approach EU… But it is also a vital concern for EU to contribute to ensuring stability, democratizing, making governance more effective, and supporting the economic development at its eastern borders” (Costea, 2011). Following the Euromaidan, the EU and Ukraine further solidified their political relations with an Association Agreement (AA) (European Union, 2014) on 21 March 2014. The AA “mark[ed] the definitive shift in the geopolitical and economic orientation of the country and the disengagement of the long Russian influence […] It [provided] the clearest demonstration of the commitment of both parties for a common future and common path” (Spiliopoulos, 2014). The Association Agreement, together with the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), marked significant advancements in trade between Ukraine and the European Union. Later on, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko signed a constitutional amendment committing Ukraine to becoming a member of NATO and the European Union (Radio Free Europe, 2019). On 19 February 2019, Poroshenko described securing Ukraine’s membership in NATO and the EU as his strategic mission; he stated that Ukraine should “submit a request for EU membership and receive a NATO membership action plan no later than 2023”, while acknowledging significant obstacles (Associated Press 2019). The purpose of this article is to summarize EU-Ukraine relations and to examine possible consequences along with political and legal obstacles to Ukrainian membership in the European Union. Finally, this report will explore an alternative path to greater cooperation without full membership. To join the European Union, applicants must complete nine steps emphasizing political agreement among member states with compliance to technical criteria (European Union, 2023). Ukraine has completed five.  States begin the accession process by submitting an application to the council, followed by the commission submitting an opinion on the application. Once EU member states unanimously grant candidate status and conditions are met, negotiations open and formally start after the commission proposes a draft framework with unanimous support from member states. Ukraine submitted its membership application shortly after the beginning of the Russian offensive on February 24th, 2022. Upon reviewing the Copenhagen criteria, the Commission issued its opinion on the application, concluding that Ukraine should have been offered the prospect of EU integration and delineating seven main areas for improvement in order for Ukraine to join the Union, mainly related to the rule of law (European Union, 2022). Ukraine was then granted candidate status on June 23rd, 2022, with the European Council inquiring on Ukraine’s progress (European Union, 2022). Ukraine secured political agreement from the member states in the European Council to grant it candidate status and begin negotiations. Following this, in February 2023, the Commission issued a report that assessed Ukraine’s capability to meet the obligations of EU membership, including the acquis, or the full body of EU law as outlined in the Treaty, secondary legislation, and EU policies (European Union, 2023). On November 8th, 2023 the Commission published its first annual enlargement report on Ukraine, where the country was assessed positively according to its progress on the seven areas (European Union, 2023). On December 14 th , 2023 the European Council accepted to start accession negotiations with Ukraine (General Secretariat of the Council to Delegations, 2023). In March 2024, the Commission proposed a draft negotiating framework for Ukraine, which outlined guidelines and principles for accession negotiations in three parts: governing principles, negotiation substance, and procedures (Press and Information Team of the Delegation to Moldova, 2024). On June 21 st , 2024 the Council of the EU approved the negotiating framework for the accession negotiations with Ukraine, fixing the first meeting of the intergovernmental conference on Ukraine’s accession to the European Union on June 25 th , 2024 (European Union, 2024). This framework stressed that Ukraine must apply the acquis as it exists at accession and ensure its timely and effective implementation. The chapters of the acquis that Ukraine must implement are organized into six clusters, as introduced by the revised enlargement methodology in 2020: Fundamentals, Internal Market, Competitiveness and Inclusive Growth, Green Agenda and Sustainable Connectivity, Resources, Agriculture and Cohesion, and External Relations (European Union, 2020). This change aimed to ensure government focus on the rule of law, democratic institutions, and economic reforms. It addressed issues of one-party control and sought to improve judicial independence. Given Ukraine’s war and history of poor governance, it is crucial to implement reforms and maintain administrative capacity to enforce EU norms. With the sixth step, formal negotiations can finally begin, with the Commission and the Ukrainian government overseeing the accession negotiations. This is the most difficult step, as the candidate country needs to incorporate the EU acquis into its governance (European Union, 2023). Currently, Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Turkey are in this stage. However, the technical challenge might stop before starting for Ukraine, as Hungary assumes the Council’s rotating presidency from July 1 st to December 31 st , 2024 (Liboreiro, 2024). Viktor Orbán’s government will control the agenda, prioritizing topics and chairing ministerial meetings. On June 18 th , Hungary’s Minister for European Affairs János Bóka confirmed that Hungary will not support opening any of the 35 chapters essential for Ukraine’s membership talks (Liboreiro 2024). Instead, Bóka emphasized focusing on the Western Balkans and ensuring the enlargement process remains “merit-based, objective, and credible”.

Source : Jason Beaubien/NPR Ukraine’s potential EU membership brings a range of significant challenges and opportunities. If admitted, Ukraine would be the EU’s largest country by landmass and would rival Poland in population. However, the ongoing war struck a blow to Ukraine’s GDP, necessitating an examination of the Copenhagen criteria, or the benchmarks for assessing a nation’s progress in terms of governance reforms that adhere to European norms. Ukraine, despite its proclaimed aspirations of liberal democratic governance, still has to implement many reforms to align with the EU. One major consideration is the EU’s agricultural budget, which heavily subsidizes farmers and agribusinesses. Ukraine’s entry would position it as the largest producer of agricultural products with some of the weakest economic farmers. This shift could redirect substantial funds away from long-standing EU members, creating economic and political tensions. Integrating and subsidizing such a large competitor may not be economically prudent and could fuel domestic instability across the Union. However, according to a study conducted by Bruegel, Ukraine’s EU membership would cost current EU countries €136 billion from 2021 to 2027, or €19 billion per year—0.13% of EU GDP (Darvas et al., 2024). This cost would minimally affect the net beneficiary status of current members. Ukraine’s membership could also positively influence the EU’s GDP through enhanced trade, migration, and foreign direct investment, leading to increased employment, production, and tax revenues. The enlargement of the EU single market through the admission of new members like Ukraine can facilitate trade, boosting domestic production and employment in existing member states. Immigration from new member states can alleviate labor shortages and address demographic challenges faced by existing members. Ukraine’s energy sector presents substantial potential, with capabilities in natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power. It could become a major exporter of low-carbon electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, and energy-intensive products like ‘green’ steel to the EU (Devlin & Mykhnenko, 2024). The reconstruction and modernization of Ukraine’s outdated and war-damaged energy infrastructure offer vast opportunities for investment, aimed at enhancing energy efficiency and maintaining or improving energy services. The demand for financial services to support energy supply and efficiency investments in Ukraine will be considerable. Political obstacles Ukraine’s path to EU membership will necessitate the establishment of clear standards for rule of law and fundamental values, along with effective mechanisms to ensure ongoing compliance post-accession. This approach is crucial to ensuring that future enlargements positively impact EU governance. Amid the ongoing war, Ukraine faces the immense challenge of implementing deep institutional changes in seven main areas, namely  (1) enacting legislation for selecting Constitutional Court judges; (2) completing integrity vetting for the High Council of Justice; (3) strengthening anti-corruption efforts and appointing key anti-corruption officials; (4) adopting anti-money laundering laws; (5) implementing the Anti-Oligarch law; (6) adopting a media law aligning with EU directives; (7) and finalizing the legal framework for national minorities based on Venice Commission recommendations . Enlargement has historically been a potent and successful tool for fostering such transformations, benefiting both the applicant country and the EU. Assessed Current Control of Terrain. Source : Institute for the Study of War A key aspect of Ukraine’s accession process will involve EU decision-making. The majority of EU decisions are taken by qualified majority voting (QMV), where a Council decision requires approval by 55% of the member states, representing at least 65 % of the EU population. Ukraine would hold about 9% of the votes, comparable to Poland’s seat shares. This would slightly decrease the shares of other member states like Germany, whose share would drop from 18.6 % to around 16.9 %. Consequently, Poland and Ukraine combined would possess relative voting weight to Germany’s. Conversely, some resolutions require unanimity inside the Council instead, such as the subject of enlargement (Zweers et al. 2024). The Council determines whether a candidate country advances in its accession process based on various criteria and, often, politics. Historically, member states have repeatedly used their veto powers to block a country’s entry into the EU for political reasons. For instance, France vetoed the UK’s membership twice in 1963 and 1967, and more recently Greece and then Bulgaria blocked Macedonia’s accession for reasons unrelated to the compliance with the technical criteria (Hajdari, 2020). This creates a clear power asymmetry in the accession process, enabling member states to dictate the pace based on their domestic political interests, and not on the reforms candidate countries are working towards. Focusing on domestic issues, member states divert attention from the essential reform efforts and transformative goals of the EU enlargement process. Security risks The EU must develop robust assistance programs to support the Ukrainian government in addressing post-war security challenges, both external and internal. This includes managing the large volume of weapons in circulation and encouraging the return of Ukrainian refugees, who will be essential for reconstruction efforts. Additionally, securing small arms and light weapons (SALW) in a post-conflict situation will be a major priority to prevent their proliferation on unsanctioned domestic and international markets which might exacerbate the danger posed by terrorist cells wanting to operate in Europe (Wisotzki 2021, 249). Additionally, the EU must remain vigilant against hybrid threats coming from Russia, such as disinformation campaigns targeted at strengthening euroskepticism in established EU members and covert information or personnel channels that Russia may have established inside Ukraine proper (Heck, 2024). U.S. Army Security Assistance Command moving military aid to Ukraine at record speeds. Source : U.S. Army Upon joining the EU, Ukraine will have one of its largest armies, experienced in countering external aggression, terrorism, cyberattacks, and modern warfare tactics (Darvas et al., 2024) . Furthermore, Ukraine’s substantial defense industry has the potential to significantly contribute to the EU’s defense sector. Article 42.7 of the Lisbon Treaty mandates that in the event of an armed attack on a member state, other member states must provide all possible assistance and aid, underscoring the collective security commitment that would extend to Ukraine (European External Action Service 2022). However, integrating Ukraine also poses risks. Small arms proliferation, potential for increased organized crime, and the management of a significant military force all require careful handling. The EU must ensure that the benefits of Ukraine’s membership, such as enhanced security and defense capabilities, outweigh these risks by implementing comprehensive strategies and support measures. The ongoing conflict with Russia means that the EU must prepare for heightened tensions and potential escalations, making diplomatic and military readiness key priorities. A Way Forward? Given the significant challenges and risks associated with Ukraine’s full membership in the EU, an alternative solution is the establishment of an Enhanced Partnership Framework (EPF). This framework could offer Ukraine closer cooperation with the EU without immediate full membership, ensuring that political, economic and security objectives are met while mitigating potential risks. The EPF would begin with a structured integration roadmap that progressively aligns Ukraine with EU standards in governance and economic policy and includes clear milestones and benchmarks, allowing for assessment of progress and necessary adjustments along the way. Enhanced trade and economic cooperation are the cornerstone of this framework. The expansion of the current Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) should include further tariff reductions, simplification of customs procedures, and channeling EU investment into Ukraine’s energy, agriculture and technology sectors to promote economic growth and stability. In addition, targeted financial assistance and structural funds would support key economic reforms and infrastructure development, with strict monitoring to ensure effective use. Security strengthening measures like defense cooperation are another critical component of the EPF. Regular joint military exercises, training programs, and robust intelligence sharing could enhance Ukraine’s defense capabilities and counter hybrid threats. Cooperation between Ukrainian and EU defense industries would further enhance technology transfer and production capabilities. To counter hybrid threats and enhance cyber security, the EPF should implement joint EU-Ukraine cyber defense initiatives to protect critical infrastructure and promote resilience to cyber attacks. Assisting Ukraine in implementing critical institutional and governance reforms is essential for long-term stability and alignment with EU standards. This support should emphasize anti-corruption measures, judicial reforms, and decentralization programs to empower local governments and improve public service delivery (Darvas et al., 2024). Encouraging and supporting the participation of civil society organizations ensures transparency and accountability in the reform process. Addressing migration and humanitarian issues is also critical. Concurrently, the EPF ought to provide support programs for Ukrainian refugees, including education, health care, and employment assistance, with incentives for eventual return to Ukraine. The creation of a dedicated fund for post-war reconstruction should integrate returning refugees and displaced persons into the reconstruction process. Gradual legal and regulatory harmonization would be achieved through sectoral agreements that align Ukrainian regulations with EU standards in areas such as environmental protection, consumer rights, and competition policy. Technical assistance would be provided to help Ukraine adopt and implement these regulations effectively. Ukrainian wheat fields after artillery shelling.

It strikes a balance between the imperative for closer collaboration between the two parties and the political and economic realities associated with attaining full EU membership. The focus on incremental integration, targeted assistance, and robust security cooperation enables Ukraine to align its domestic policies with those of the EU while mitigating potential risks and fostering mutual benefits. Moreover, this approach contributes to regional stability and economic growth, thereby strengthening the preparedness of both Ukraine and the EU to navigate future challenges and opportunities. In conclusion, while Ukraine’s path to EU membership involves navigating significant political and economic hurdles, the potential benefits are substantial. Achieving this integration will require strategic planning and substantial reforms, ensuring that Ukraine aligns with EU standards and contributes positively to the Union’s future.

All Rights Reserved. Entertainment Trump Retweets ‘Best Eclipse Ever’ Photo Of Trump Eclipsing Obama From Jerry Travone Meme – Racism Cries Ensue Published on: August 24, 2017 at 9:45 AM By Paula Mooney President Donald Trump may have gotten a lot of ribbing about watching the total solar eclipse without always wearing his protective glasses on Monday, but by Thursday, August 24, Trump was feeling the heat for retweeting a photo of Trump eclipsing former President Obama. As reported by ABC News , Trump retweeted the meme that was tweeted at President Trump by Jerry Travone. Travone describes himself as a political junkie and a YouTube Actor, as well as a “proud Trump supporter” out of New Jersey. However, the retweet with Trump as the moon eclipsing Obama as the sun isn’t going over well with everyone on Twitter, and folks are questioning Trump’s fitness as president as a result. Comments claiming that Trump as the moon is applicable, since the moon changes tides and brings “the crazy out in some people” are being made beneath Trump’s Twitter retweet. Others are writing that they would take Obama as the sun any day over Trump. What’s troubling to many Twitter users is that the President of the U.S. would retweet such a divisive meme, and some are calling Trump mentally ill and unfit to serve. Some Twitter comments call Trump a president who can’t hold a candle to Obama, and urge President Trump to seek therapy. pic.twitter.com/6XJxEg1gSs — Jerry Razor Travone™? (@JerryTravone) August 24, 2017 The inappropriate nature of the Trump retweet is what other viewers are focused upon, with claims that Trump is encouraging racism from the tweet that shows Obama in black and white and Trump in color. “This is unbelievably inappropriate. You are the president to all Americans. Stop egging racists on.” Yet and still others are creating their own memes, like the one below, which shows Obama’s smiling face eclipsing Trump’s face. pic.twitter.com/pMLmEF3uV2 — Dycadon (@Dyann057) August 24, 2017 Much of the response to Trump’s retweet features disbelief that the president of a country would use social media in such a trivial manner. In order to make the meme correct, Trump has to turn around and stare into the sun, wrote one Twitter user, like Trump did in real life on Monday. Others are calling Trump egomaniacal for retweeting such a meme, and are begging Trump to resign from the presidency amid all the controversy.
