    set1 &lt;- rnorm(1000, mean=0, sd=1)
    set2 &lt;- rnorm(100, mean=5, sd=1)
    set3 &lt;- rnorm(100, mean=10, sd=1)
    allpoints &lt;- c(set1, set2, set3)

When you plot the density of allpoints, you get a nice big hill, followed by two small one, as expected, of course. Basically my data comes from a set of multiple normal distributions, but I assume these could be other distributions as well.

Now what I want to do: starting from allpoints, give me a set of three (let's say we know the amount beforehand) mean/sdpairs which form normal distributions which fits the given dataset in the best way. So basically, I want means=c(0, 5, 10) and sd=(0, 5, 10) returned to me (or something in the vicinity, a best guess).

A feel that there is probably a function to do this exact thing but could not find it due to my inexperience. Can anybody help me out here? The closest I came was using kmeans to find three clusters, and using the mean/sd of each cluster to construct the three distributions, still, this feels as the wrong way to do this.

Ayudame!",9ljrd,authorblues,1211915825.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9ljrd/dear_mleddit_i_have_a_few_questions_about/,15.0,17.0,"So we are studying Artificial Neural Networks as one of our first steps in my machine learning course, and I have some questions for which I don't think I want to go to my professor:

**Background:** I am developing the same old alpha-beta search-tree pruning chess playing program that everyone else in the world has. I plan to, at some point, set it up to run on a Beowulf cluster or some other sort of distributed network in order to push it faster. I would like, however to set up its ""base case"" (evaluation of a single position in a chess game as the leaf of the tree) to be evaluated through a neural network, one that I have trained with the large amount of expert data (LARGE amount) I have collected. Evaluation will be the process of assigning a ""score"" to a position, with a maximum score of K, where a score of +K is the best possible score in favor of white, and -K is the best possible score in favor of black.

**Expert Data:** A bit more information about my expert data: chess games are often stored in a notation called PGN, the most important details given in this expert data is A) who won the game (which I think I can use to decide whose moves to categorize positively and whose moves to categorize negatively), and B) every move made, which I already have a system capable of parsing these moves.

1) I know that the basis of training a neural network (and really the basis of any machine learning training phase) is attempting to achieve results as close to a target function as possible. In this case, I don't have a ""known"" target function. I just want to be as ""correct"" as possible. In cases like this, where the target function isn't known up-front, but can really only be assessed later (as in, this player won, so his moves should possibly be scored higher), how is the best way to achieve this goal?

2) For a chessboard representation, there are many pieces of information that can be gathered: what piece is on a square, how many of one piece are on a board, where is a particular piece located (sort of the reverse of ""what piece is on a square""), what is the ""positional value"" (some pieces are more suited at particular locations on the board) or ""material value"" (some pieces are worth more than others) of a board, things of this nature. What should the input to a neural network given the abundance of data available regarding each position? is it feasible to expect the input nodes to be 64 nodes representing each position on the board, and this be enough for the network to be able to learn the subtle nuances between pieces and positions and strength?

In regards to (2), I’m not asking what my input set should be. I don’t want you guys to do my work for me. I just don’t know whether or not ONLY providing the 64 squares of the board as input data is a realistic input set to expect the results I’m wanting.

3) Is it problematic -- or really, does it even matter -- that the input set is likely to be discrete, while I’m wanting continuous output? I don’t think I quite grasp whether or not this is an issue with neural networks.

4) Is it possible to give a neural network “negative” training data? I’m not sure if it would help or hurt, but with this wealth of expert data I have, I could potentially use the loser as negative training data. If I can’t, I honestly have more than enough “positive” data that this shouldn’t be a problem.",en

For example (see image http://imgur.com/0hfDY.jpg) the first pair has about 49% of deviation in common, while the 7th pair shares about 15% (but in opposite directions).  

But no matter how I do this kind of math, I never get the Pearson correlation score.  What is my conceptual mistake?

I think it might be that correlation is actually a measure of “part to whole” (observed covariance relative to maximum possible covariance), whereas my conceptual approach is “pattern of common variance amongst pairs”, which is NOT correlation, but something else??

The first set is normally distributed.  The second set is drawn from the same distribution as the first, but differs in one crucial way: all observations in the set that are larger than some value (N) are transformed such that X = X + B, where B is another normally distributed positive variable.

Is there some method I could use to find N, without knowing B?

For example:
Set 1:

1

1

2

2

2

3

3

Set 2:

1

1

2

2

2

6

6

Here the value of N is 2 and the value of B is 3.  In my actual data I have &gt;100 such sets, one per human subject.

I thought about finding N as the value that minimizes the p-value of a t-test between the two sets, but I realized that the data used in that process wouldn't conform to the normality assumptions of the t-test.

Then I thought about using k-means clustering with k=2 on the second set and then looking at the proportion of cases which belong to the cluster with a larger value, but this seems like a sloppy solution.

Please, stats geniuses, help me out...

I am currently in my last quarter of undergrad at a 2nd-tier UC doing computer science, and am interested in machine learning. I've taken a couple grad-level Machine Learning classes and have been having a lot of fun with my homework and projects. I also have several years' experience working as a software engineer and am currently working (nearly) full-time.

Since I am supporting my fiancee who is also in school right now (and will be for a while), I don't think grad school is an immediate option for me without taking on enormous amounts of debt. Does anyone know of an employer who will consider someone without an advanced degree for a position doing data mining / machine learning? Any tips on getting into the specialty with only a BS in CS?

Ultimately, I would like to be doing work creating/adapting algorithms to solve interesting problems (recommendation engines, advertising optimization, IR, NLP, etc), but wouldn't mind maintaining/enhancing existing systems at first to get my feet wet if needed.

Edit: Thanks for the interesting and insightful comments everyone!

What I'm going to do is find work doing some type of ML ASAP (or at least in proximity to the guys doing it) and then figure out how to afford to get a Master's once I have a little bit more experience applying the stuff. BTW, I got some anonymous comments that there are companies out there that are not too hung up on the piece of paper... so I guess it's like the rest of the industry: if you're good at it, someone will hire you to do it!",en

The labels in the train set look more or less like this:

    000000???111111???00000????111??0000??22222????00000
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

The x-axis here is time, the numbers on the first row are the labels I know about and the question marks are there because I don't exactly know what the labels there should be. The second row is just used to refer to timepoints in this example. The question marks really show transitions from one label into another, but I don't know exactly where the transition is. This means that a question mark should be one of the two surrounding labels (and not anything else) and that if we have AA????BB and the second question mark is a B, then the next ones should also be B's.
My first problem is basically how to incorporate the information I do have about these samples in my algorithm.

The second problem has to do with the fact that not all labels are equally important. If for every group of non-zero's just one would be classified correctly and the rest would be classified as zero, that would be great. So in the above example I would be happier if all samples would be classified as zeros except *m*, *B* and *O* than if for instance *j-o* would be classified correctly and the rest would be zeros, even though the latter would technically give a higher accuracy.
My second problem is thus how to deal with this unequal preference for different labels.

I guess I could just ignore all of this information I have, but the problem is that when I do that, performance is very bad. Of course, there is no guarantee that using it will make things much better, but I'm hoping it will.

I'm still quite new to this field, so if anyone could point me in the direction of algorithms that can be used for this, suggest resources that apply to this or even (like books, webpages or other places to ask questions like this; a StackOverflow for science questions would be great) come up with solutions for my problems, that would be great! I've tried to keep this as abstract and general as possible and I hope it is still clear what the problem is. If not, please ask and I will try to clarify.

My eventual goal is to be able to take a series of points and order them by decreasing likelihood.  In other words, I don't need to estimate the probability function, but an order preserving transform of the probability function.  My first thought was to just estimate the original function, because it's obviously order preserving with itself, but as I started to tune the smoothing (bandwidth) parameters I was finding that I needed to over-smooth the distribution quite a bit to get good results.  It looks like having a bit of variance is just fine if I'm trying to minimize the error between my estimate and the underlying distribution, but if I'm concerned about ordering, it completely kills me.  

Does anyone out there know a better technique for reconstructing a likelihood function for a set of samples?  Or maybe a modification to my kernel estimator that would help?  Please ask me questions, if you don't understand exactly what I'm going for.  I doubt my explanation is all that clear.

I'm going to be graduating next spring.  I'm an English/Criminology major, and I've been introduced to statistics through the latter.  I've decided that I'm really interested in pursuing a Master's degree for it.   I'm mainly interested in data visualization after realizing that I really like graphs and charts (alot).

Unfortunately, not counting the stats in behavioral science class I took recently, my mathematical education basically ended after Algebra 2 in high school.  How far do I need to go in order to apply for a graduate program for Statistics without having to take remedial math classes while completing it(if that's even possible)?  I'm assuming up to the equivalent of Calculus I at my school, but I really have no clue. 

I'd assume the progression would be trigonometry-precal-beginning calculus, since that's what it was in high school.  I intend to learn on my own, since taking classes won't be an option as I'm already taking the maximum number of classes after asking for a unit extension.  If anyone could recommend specific textbooks for me to plow through, or even some sort of amazing condensed book (or books), that would be grand.

I'm assuming that I'll be given a proficiency test as part of the admissions process, since I won't have a B.S. or even any math at the collegiate level.  At least I'm hoping that this will be the case, as opposed to having to take math classes at a CC beforehand or something.

I also don't know anything about the GRE aside from the fact that it's a test that I have to take.  Are there different types?  Is there a specific math or statistics GRE that I'd be taking?  If so, would doing sufficiently well on that possibly be enough to satisfy the presumed undergraduate mathematical requirements?

Aside from math, how much programming is expected?  Presumably I'll be expected to know R, but will that be enough?

Once again, I know this is mostly stuff I should be asking a representative, but I'd appreciate any advice.  Thanks.",en

The material begins [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=ENvojTAm0TwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=statistical%20methods%20in%20bioinformatics&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false) (I can post by hand if there are problems). I'm unclear on what the meaning of *o(h)* is in this context (described in (2)).",en

I'm about 1/4 of the way done. I think it's really valuable knowledge so I'm going through every detail and developing a deep understanding. 

I'm hungry for real problems to solve, for real projects. It's exciting to see there are plenty of them I can engage on online.

However, learning and exploring potential projects is much more fun, productive and efficient when done in a group.

We could work through this course together. We now have a CrunchCourse page! We can start using the forum http://www.crunchcourse.com/class/stanford-cs229-machine-learning/2010/jan/

Summary of the course:
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs; VC theory; large margins); reinforcement learning and adaptive control. The course will also discuss recent applications of machine learning, such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous navigation, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data processing.",en

1-02-09,GOOG,453.52
etc. Except a couple hundred rows per ticker.

What I would like to do is plot price over time for all tickers, but since the data set is so huge, I can't do it in Excel.  I would prefer R, since it has manipulatable graphics outputs, so a large image would be preferable.  Can anybody point me in the right direction?

I am playing around with different image segmentation techniques to find obstacles (just the big ones like trees and buildings) so the path can be routed around them.  It doesn't have to be 100% accurate, if the other sensors detect something in the way the path can be changed, but it would be nice if it could still give a good high level view of the best route to get to the destination so that the amount of changes would be minimal.  Right now I think cluster-based segmentation is the way to go (so far the best results have come from a self-organizing feature map).  This is my first experience doing anything with computer vision, however, so I was wondering if maybe anyone here has good suggestions for other strategies to tackle this problem.",en

But semi-supervised techniques, usually tend to have higher computational cost when compared to other techniques. But cluster and label or cotraining approaches are still in my mind. I have tested SVM(C-SVC in libsvm) on my dataset and got 91% percent accuracy rate but lasted about 13 min. Also tested C4.5 and got 85 percent accuracy rate but it finished under 5 min. Both algorithms are tested with default parameters without fine-tuning. C4.5 is quick and it can get better accuracy by using boosting. But i don't want to use C4.5 for personal reasons :). Bayesian techniques that i have tested are also too slow and have long training time. What is you opinion?

So quite awhile ago, I ordered a Papa John's pizza online. My job largely involves looking at ads that appear online, so afterwards I was quick to notice *I was getting a LOT* of Papa Johns ads (especially at night) being served through a Google owned company (DoubleClick media). Yesterday one of these ads popped up again on Youtube (a place that typically serves using the adwords program, not doubleclick), so I decided to copy the URL. 

For those not in the advertising field: Making full use of Google's analytics tool means that certain information about the advertising campaign is leaked in the URL.

So let's break it apart: 

&gt;http://ad.doubleclick.net/click;h=(junk here);~sscs=?http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=(junk here)&amp;adurl=http://www.papajohns.com/index.shtm?utm_source=googlenetwork&amp;utm_medium=DisplayCPC&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleRemarketing

First off, we see ~sscs: ~sscs is doubleclick's redirect variable. So rather than directly serving adwords ads, they overrode it to serve through doubleclick, then redirect through what would otherwise be an adwords link(http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net). This is tighter integration than is generally seen with adwords/doubleclick.

* The interesting part is the end variables utm_source=**googlenetwork**&amp;utm_medium=**DisplayCPC**&amp;utm_campaign=**GoogleRemarketing**

* DisplayCPC/googlenetwork - Confirmation that doubleclick is now more finely integrated with adwords.

* ""GoogleRemarketing"", huh? Let's take a look at the definition for ""Remarketing""

&gt;Using past campaign information to target a particular message to an audience.

While in the past behavioral targetting has largely been based on the sum of your use, this is an interesting(though no doubt more widespread than is known) change in that; explicitly targeting old customers though a *massive* network of sites.

-----------------------------------

Just thought I'd put this out there. I'm sure it's not new to a lot of people, but at least to me it was interesting to see concepts like this actually put into practice on such a large scale.

I have 35 different pairs of these time series; each pair is independent from every other pair, and each series within a pair is independent of the other series.  However, each series is spatially and temporally autocorrelated - the data is voltage fluctuations on the scalp collected from 35 individuals in two different tasks.  

I've read that Pearson's R shouldn't be used in such situations, but I don't know why.  Should I use R's ccf? Do I just need to prewhiten the data?  Please have mercy!

EDIT: If any stats people can help out, then I have a juicy paper idea for you: if I'm correct in thinking that t-tests between two autocorrelated timeseries are also inappropriately skewed by autocorrelations, then you can single-handedly take down the #1 most common practice in ERP research - which is t-tests between two highly correlated and autocorrelated timeseries.  Voila, instant paper in *Neuroimage*, *Psychophysiology*, or *J Neurosci Methods* - your pick, if that floats your boat.

2nd Edit: In a certain manner of thinking, this is simply a non-independence of errors problem.  While it's standard to do prewhitening in fMRI, I've never seen this in ERP research.",en

The inspiration for this project is simple: I can't stand using laptop touchpads, and most laptops these days have an integrated webcam. I think it would be neat to be able to point at things simply by moving my hand in front of the screen.

Part of the tracking software is a Viola-Jones type detector that will search an area of the screen to determine the presence and location of the user's hand. To train the detector I need a large amount of samples. I'd be ever so grateful if you could take a minute and provide me with some samples.

What I need: photos of your hand in the specific posture shown in [this pic](http://imgur.com/3qYpA.png). Even if you can only provide one photo that'll be a great help. Don't fret about quality; so long as it's not all blurry it's fine. If you want to be even more helpful though, you could take a short video clip of 50-100 frames (a few seconds worth) with you moving your hand around. If you want to be totally amazing you could take multiple clips at different locations so I have different backgrounds and lighting to train with. I'd also like to have a shot of the background on its own with no hand so I can take negative samples from it.

When you've made your sample(s) you can either upload them somewhere and post links in this thread or email them to me at blaidd.of.reddit@googlemail.com.

The number of SNPs is still large enough to warrant some penalized regression method, such as LASSO (which she prefers because of the inherent selection mechanism). Some of the SNPs have not been obtained for the whole data set. So she is thinking about performing MI on the explanatory variables.

Penalized methods are largely about minimising the sum of the deviance of the model plus a penalty term which is nondecreasing in the absolute value of the regression coefficients. MI introduces another source of variance brought about by the uncertainty over the precise values of the missings. In simple models, this term is simply added to the mean variance of the estimate in the model, one does not try to refit the model in the attempt of minimising the sum of these variances. It seems that it is assumed (I don't have a textbook at hand here) that these two variances are independent.

My question is: Could this simple approach be taken with penalised regression too, or do I have to include the imputation variance into the minimisation problem, i.e. have to go through an additional cycle?

To finish in one week.  

I am starting a simple startup after this and am looking for some co-founders.   Mainly 1 Web developer and 1 Machine Learning/Web Developer if possible.  This project will serve as a very simple spring board.  Think of this as a trial in which the outcome doesn’t matter and cost nothing and we build something cool.   After we work together we will have a good idea of what people would be good to work with and we can discuss where to go from there.  
If you want to join send me a message and lets get started!
Edit: Ok I created a google group, as its simplest and fastest way to collaborate.

I generally try to stay away from math and statistics but based on what I'm currently doing and some conversations I've had, I cannot get this concept out of my head.

Basically, I need an answer but I don't know enough to search for it without having to sift through a lot of unrelated material. I'm looking for some help from someone who deals in probability all the time in some capacity.

Anyway, the root problem is two decks of cards shuffled into one deck (termed a shoe). You have to draw 2 cards. What is the probability that both cards will be the same?

So, this is how I personally simplified it to try to figure this out. Let's say you have a 6 sided die with only 3 distinct values. Rolling the die once has equal probability of 1/3 even though the values repeat, it should still reduce down from 2/6 to 1/3. Anyway, let's say I take that die and black out one side with marker. The value is no longer available. Let's pretend I black out side 3. What is the new probability that I will roll a 3 since one's gone?

I can believe that no matter how many decks you shove in a shoe, it's always going to reduce to 1/52 because you draw one and there are only 52 distinct values. 

Any input here would be greatly appreciated. ",en

According to a survey, 60% of parents with children condone spanking as a regular form of punishment. Consider a random sample of 3 people with children, assume that x, the number in the sample that condone spanking, is a binomial random variable.

n=3 π=0.6

Using the binomial probability distribution-p(x) = C(n,x)(π^x)(1-π)^(n-x) I can come up with this table.
    x | p(x)
    0 |0.064
    1 |0.288
    2 |0.432
    3 |0.216

So, µ = nπ = 1.8

I can interpret that to mean that on average, 1.8 people out 3 people who have children will condone spanking.

σ^2 = nπ(1-π) = 3*0.6*0.4  = 0.72
σ = .85

(µ±σ) = (0.95, 2.65)
(µ±2σ) = (0.1, 3.5)

This means 95% of the population should fall between .1 and 3.5. But, because n=3 and we can not have 0.1 people, we can look at the range of 1 to 3. The actual population is 93.6%. This is close to the 95% that we were expecting to see.

Would this be the correct interpretation?

I not looking for one or two specific data points, but more for generic input to give my mind some external stimuli to crunch on. As such, please bear with me if it gets rambly.

I'm currently working on a perl library to calculate averages on a given list of values. As a bit of explanation how i got to this: On my way to losing some weights I've written a web app to help me track things, which also creates graphs: http://i43.tinypic.com/9gdl3q.png

During the development process i strove to make the averages, specifically the red line in the top chart, fit the data points as close as possible.

I started out with a moving average, soon converted that to an exponentially smoothed moving average, then got annoyed by how that lagged behind the data constantly and first experimented with offsetting its display, and then in the last step made it not only take the data before each point into account, but also the data that came after it, resulting in what you currently see in the top red line in the linked chart.

After looking at that code i began cleaning it up a bit and i realized that I'd pretty much created a library to calculate generic moving averages with all sorts of properties. Currently i have this set of properties:
    * view window, input parameters to define on which data points in the input list
      averages should be calculated
    * look-around window size, how many other data points should be taken into
      account for the calculation of the average of each data point
    * look-around window offset, how much should the range of data points used to
      calculate an average for one data point moved forwards/backwards
    * alternatively: look-around window start/end (essentially window size and offset
      are used to calculate start and end of the window)
    * alternatively: balanced average with the look-around window centered on the
      data point and extended by a size in both directions
    * weighting method (currently only exponential)
    * weighting factor

Now the things I am pondering are these:
    * what's the official name for an input data point in this situation? (i'm german
      and have no formal statistics education)
    * what's the official name for a single data point involved in the calculation of
      an average for another data point?
    * what are the official names for various kinds of moving averages that can be
      generated with this kind of algorithm?
    * what other weighting methods exist?
    * am i missing other possible parameters?

In case anyone is inclined and knowledgable, here's the current perl code: http://pastebin.com/5h0gh9G4 (Not everything is implemented yet, I'm still thinking on some topics.)

Thanks in advance for any comments!

Let's say I have 2 studies on a specific subject on my desk.  Both the studies asked the question ""How much are you willing to pay for item a?"".  For both studies, the same sample size was used (1000) chosen randomly from a population (100000, age group 20 - 30 etc.).  The time between the studies was 1 month.    

Study *a* concludes, that on average people are willing to pay 5$ for the item, with the standard deviance being 0.5$.    

Study *b* concludes, that on average people are willing to pay 6$ for the item, standard deviance being 1$.

I am aware that as sample size tends to population size, sample average approaches population average.  So I might be tempted to merge the two studies together.  However, if I am supposed to make assumptions about the population (with relation to the price value on item a) based on those two studies, how do I approach this problem?

The p of drawing any first rack is 1.0 and the p of drawing that specific rack a second time is the p of drawing those 7 tiles.  But when your first rack is unknown it becomes more difficult.  The way I've been trying to approach it is by trying to compute an ""average probability"" of drawing any first rack and then squaring that.  I know my language isn't technical and I might be very wrong in my logic. Ill discuss my approach more later, but I need to move out of my dorm right now.

scrabble tile distribution: http://boardgames.about.com/od/scrabble/a/tile_distribute.htm

Edit: Should've been more clear before but I was in a rush.  I am interested in drawing the same opening rack in consecutive games, so yes the tiles would be replenished after the 7th tile is drawn.  It seems like I was on the right track with my thinking, but as some of you have pointed out it would take an insane amount of time to calculate the actual value. ",en

I'm doing my own tests, and I want to know if I am simulating this random variable correctly. I'm still running the simulation, but at the current time, I predict a mean of 44.75 with about the same confidence interval. This means the standard deviation of each of our predictions is about 10.

How can I quantitatively measure the likelihood that I am measuring the same random variable? I can plot the two normal distributions, one from each of our estimates, and say ""hey, looks kinda close"".

Suppose you have samples from a completely unknown real-valued distribution. If all of the samples have unique values, is there any sensible way to define the sample entropy of your observations? When using something like variance to measure spread, it's really useful to condition the observations on some other variable and then observe a decrease in the ""spread.""

This question is trading related but I think is actually grounded in basic stats. I've no formal training in Stats. Please help me.  

I have a basic question on VWAP and TWAP. I'm having some trouble getting to understand this intuitively.

1. I think VWAP helps traders benchmark their performance for a stock over a period of time, say the whole day. The VWAP price basically is the price at which the total day's trades would occur for the given notional value, if we were to have ONLY ONE TRADE.

So for 3 trades in a day (suppose)

2000@500
5000@501
1000@500

the vwap is 500.625. Fair enough.

Then why do traders use historical vwap? What is its use if VWAP should actually be a realtime calculation, so that one can execute trades in proportion to the total market volume, so as to get the vwap price?

2. TWAP as I understand is the average price of the execution over a specified time period. So why is this called 'Time Weighted' ? Isn't it misleading, because its finally just an average price, and has nothing to do with time as a weight?
  
Tks!

First, my background. I did well in a couple of c++/java courses in college, but that was a few years back. It would take a bit of a refresher to do simple file i/o.

From what I can gather in Mr. Hawkins' book, however, it seems that it would be relatively simple to create an ""object"" that can pass on information to a higher level object. After a period of time, it can begin to recognize patterns (hmm, how it would recognize patterns would not be so trivial I imagine), and pass on those patterns to the higher level object. Then based on prediction of when those patterns occur, it could fire its response to the higher object before the pattern even finishes. Of course there would have to be a feedback channel, sending information ""down"" back to the beginning.

So I guess my question is, as someone with next to no AI experience, what are the barriers here? The basic structure of the brain (going only a few levels deep) seems somewhat ""easy"" to accomplish.

My apologies for my deep-seeded ignorance. :) Just a curious mind, I guess.

Therefore, instead of analyzing just the accuracy of the classifier across Conditions A and B, I thought I'd want to analyze the effect size of the classifier's accuracy across Conditions A and B.  This can be done by using the t-statistics from a t-test of classifier accuracy in each condition against chance levels of classification for each condition.

However, in Condition A, the classifier kicks so much ass that it's at 100% accuracy 100% of the time for each subject; when I attempt to calculate the t-statistic I then need to divide by zero.  

The question: Is there a principled transformation I can use to make standard deviation nonzero, so that I can get t-statistics?  Just using an arbitrarily small value changes the t-statistics by an arbitrary amount, so I'm not comfortable with that.  I know there are similar transformations used in cases where an observer has a perfect hit rate (1 - 1/(2N)) for calculating dprime.  Is there something similar for st. dev?  Or should I give up on this and just build a three-level hierarchical model?

TL;DR: my standard deviation for one condition is truly, actually zero, but I need to calculate its t-statistic to compare it with another condition that is far less reliable.  Help!

EDIT: what about using a ""pooled variance"" estimate (i.e., the average variance across all conditions) for A?  This is at least a nonzero value, and it seems that such ""pooled variance"" techniques are sometimes used (although new to me).",en

We have two different measurements counts and current. We measure the counts from a sample for two seconds then its current and repeat. These two numbers are divided (counts/current) to provide a ratio. For each time we measure the sample we will have a few dozen of these ratios. My thought was if the count rate is high enough (more than a couple per second) we should be able to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean and report that as the error. Is this the appropriate way to do it? Also if there are few counts (less than 1 every 2 seconds) you can run into the case where several measurements have counts 0 and counts 1 leading to a split distribution rather than a nice normal one. How do we deal with that case?

I've enjoyed reading the different educational links and discussions we've had on this subreddit. Our group is certainly diverse, with readers who are working in chemistry, business, and other academic / non-academic contexts. 

A few times, people have come here and tried to ask questions on analysis approaches or graphical representations or other things. These can be frustrating for us because they are full of jargon, shorthands, acronyms and have no clear, defined scientific question.

To start a point of reference, it might be good to outline a general structure for getting a representative quorum of our Reddit trained statisticians (or statistically trained Reddittors :) )

* Make a short, suggestive title. Phrase it in the infinitive so that filler words don't lead to ambiguous language. For instance instead of ""How do you get the difference in survival rates between control group and treatment group assigned tamoxifen"" just say ""Calculating difference in survival between two groups"". The rest can be explained in the body of the submission.

* Give a good solid paragraph of scientific background so that we can understand the problem. Define jargon. Use your Standard Academic Approach to Acronyms [SAAA], SAAA can help keep entries short and clear and teach us something too.

* Ask a clear well defined question. If it's not quantitative, we might bounce a few ideas off of you to get things rolling. If there are several things you want to compare, that's fine, but don't entangle them into a single question because it's just confusing. Different sentences for different ideas.

* Mention any approaches you are trying and why there might be a problem (e.g. the reviewer says they want a non-parametric test).

* Be open to different philosophies. Different people have had different training and backgrounds and will potentially recommend wildly different strategies for each problem.

* Try to use the correct language for your problem. We might have to retool your thinking because a conventional word can mean something completely different in statistics. Frequently, researchers ask how to test if two variables are correlated. By ""correlated"" they often mean something different from statistical correlation, the ratio of covariance to standard deviation of both variables, but want to know if any change in one variable effects a change in another variable.

* If there's a serious statistical precedent in your field, we need to know about it. For instance, in psychology, some scores for certain disorders are almost always analyzed using linear regression. If we didn't know that, we might suggest a proportional odds model or another cumulative link if the number of categories are small. We're obviously not gonna poke around 12-13 articles in the Journal of Psychiatric Research to find this out.

That's all I can think about for now. Sorry if it sounds pompous or absolutist. I'm willing to edit things down based on our consensus here.",en

I'm by no means educated about any of this but I do find it interesting. My question is basically about what would be the best way (most accurate) to threshold a certain color in an image? 

I understand I have to train the system to recognize the color first. So far, I have taken images of a blue box, converted the pixels to YCbCr, generated a histogram, and computed the min max of each channel. I did this 10 or so times in different lighting to get better results. Then I use the ranges I get to threshold the pixels (except for Y channel) from an incoming video to get the color. The results have not been amazing, but it does work (it's pretty bad with shadows on the object). I also tried to do the same thing with the HSI color space.

I'm sure there are more efficient ways to do this, and I will probably experiment with [this](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/papers/wirevision00.pdf) [PDF]. As I said, most of the stuff I'm doing is experimentation and some limited research. So, is there a specific color space I should be using for better results? Is gathering the min and max of a histogram a good way of finding the color ranges of the item? Really, any advice would be helpful.

I'm sure there are libraries like OpenCV that would make this simpler, but I want to try getting my hands dirty first. Also, sorry if this is not exactly the right place to post this, I'm unaware of another subreddit.

Thanks!",en

I have a set of samples X of a continuous variable along with a subset of these samples Y. There is an upper limit on the number of possible samples each of these sets could contain (i.e. they are taken from a set of possible outcomes of finite size X' and Y' respectively) with |Y| &lt; |X| always, but the number of samples is always going to be much lower than the maximum. |X'| and |Y'| are known. I want to know if the expected value of a sample taken from Y' (E(Y')) is better calculated as E(Y) or E(X).

e.g. if Y = {1}, X = {0.5, 1.6}, |Y'| = 10 and |X'| = 100 is 1 or (0.5 + 1.6)/2 a better approximation of E(y in Y')?

I am finishing my PhD at a top 10 uni; unfortunately, the key thing that I learned over those years is that, well, I chose the wrong field. My PhD is the story of a man with a stats / econ background, who started a PhD in economics and slowly migrated to the most statisticsy corners of economics. I dislike economic research, am not too fond of economists in general; yet have a passion for data and estimation.

So I will be looking for a job pretty soon. I don't know what kind exactly. Could be anything from clinical trials to a postdoc in stats, or a statistician job in a private firm of some kind. I do have some jobs in mind that I would particularly like, but am flexible in my expectations.

Being based in London, I was thinking of going to [the RSS international conference](http://www.rss.org.uk/rss2010) to get a chance to meet a few statisticians and get their opinion on my CV; as well as get a better picture of what is hot in statistics than I can see from my economics vantage point. Do you guys think that's a silly idea? I basically know next to nobody doing stats in the UK; it is mostly a jump into the unknown. My undergrad diploma does qualify me as a statistician; and my PhD is very quantitative; so I got the skills, and what I don't have I am very motivated about acquiring.

What do you guys think? Any opinion is very, very welcome.",en

Since then I've worked a few different jobs, each of which was awful in its own special way.  This included a short stint in a bank, and a few years at internet / tech companies.  


The technical high point of my work-life has been building linear regression models and some control/test (or A/B test) analyses.  More commonly I find myself spending my days writing SQL queries, looking at descriptive statistics and studying trends of X (substitute with metric of interest) over time.  It has been somewhat mundane.


As time goes on, I find myself forgetting all the nifty things I had learned at school.  It has come to a point that, when I do see a  challenging problem, it makes me nervous.  I'm unsure of whether I still have the skills to tackle it.

Is this what most statistics jobs are like?
If not, where do you work?  And what kinds of things do you do on a daily basis?

I am curious to know how this paper has been received in the stat community. I learnt from it that the original reason (due to Fisher) for the squared approach to measuring dispersion is that it is more consistent while sampling (the deviation of the deviations is smaller when taking many samples) than with the absolute deviation approach. Why then stop at squares, why not cubes? Why not higher powers as a measure of dispersion?

For the sake of example, think of it as the number of ants found in different parts of a football pitch.

The biological count data is in an x by y grid, and the only two options I have been given are a Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test or a two-way ANOVA.  The conclusions will be of the form ""yes, distance along the x-axis does affect the biological count"" etc.

None of the data fits a normal distribution (P&lt;0.005), and that's not at all surprising - there are lots of zeroes (which is characteristic of biological count data).  I have been trying to think logically about what transformations I could apply to transform the data into a normal distribution, allowing me to use a parametric test which (so I'm told) will allow me to make more conclusions.  

And this is where my brain hurts.

I think I'm comfortable with applying transformations to the data, then testing for normality.  But is it acceptable to eliminate some of the 'zero' data, and then perform a statistical test just on a certain portion of the data?  Using the ants-on-a-football-pitch example, it would be a matter of concluding ""in this particular quarter of the pitch where ants are found, the distance from the goal does make a difference to ant population""

Or by doing that am I chucking out real zero data?  This 'zero data' isn't just ""meh we didn't bother looking"", we actually observed that in these areas the biological count was zero, so it is data.

Maybe the answer is just ""stop butchering your data and just stick with a non-parametric test""...?

TL;DR Do you think it's acceptable to make statistical conclusions about a small portion of biological count data and ignore the rest?",en

In, this particular case, I'm comparing a measured temperature value with a modeled value.  

I'm just not sure what is the best way to carry out the comparison.  Currently, I'm just using a one sample confidence interval on the pairwise difference since this difference has a normal distribution.  Would it be better to use a two sample approach and assume either equal or unequal variance? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!


*Example:*


Lets say there is a weather station measuring the air temperature.  A model is run which creates a forecast of the maximum daily temperature 5 days from now.  I need to create a confidence interval on mean difference between the actual maximum temperature recorded by the weather station and what the model predicted it was going to be today.  Therefore, each observation will be comparing two values at the same point in time (5 days from now in this case), but there will 5 day lag between time that weather prediction was generated and the time that the actual measurement was recorded. 


In this case, I feel that the observations should be independent since the difference between the values at one point in time should not affect the difference between the values in the future (feel free to correct me!).

&gt;This ancestral structure was likely a group of densely packed cells, which received and processed information about smell and directly controlled locomotion. It may have enabled our ancestors crawling over the sea floor to identify food sources, move towards them, and integrate previous experiences into some sort of learning.

Compare to my suggestion here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/8uwcq/are_worms_intelligent/

&gt; This is me trying to start thinking about my own understanding of intelligence.
My idea is that maybe the basic capabilities of intelligent systems are less numerous and complex than most people think. Maybe its starts with a basic ability that even a worm or an insect has, and that just gets elaborated on and scaled up all the way to humans.

&gt; A worm has to do some things that are actually pretty smart when you compare them with the abilities of the average computer:

&gt; * integrate fairly arbitrary patterns of sensory information from its environment with a time dimension

&gt; * use this information to determine the actions that will most likely lead to a desired set of sensory patterns in the future

&gt; In other words, it has to, for example, **move in the direction of a scent to obtain food.**

&gt; My theory is that perhaps the worm must be intelligent in order to do this and that the difference between worm intelligence and human intelligence might just be a matter of something like being able to handle more complex sensory relationships over greater time spans and also having more built-in patterns for predicting the correct actions and integrating senses.

In intro stats courses, you learn about normal distributions, and how they show up all the time in everyday life (i.e. if you measure the heights of a lot of people, they will be approximately normally distributed).  

But what's the history of this function?  I can think of three possibilities: 

* Scientists and/or mathematicians had a lot of data (of normally distributed variables like height) and noticed that when you plotted the frequencies, they tended to converge to a specific function.  
* Instead, they noticed patterns in the data (2/3 of the data fall within one sd of the mean, almost all fall within three sd of the mean, etc...) and wrote a mathematical equation that fit those parameters.  
* They already had this equation for some reason, then noticed that real-word data tended to follow it.

In the first two scenarios, the equation was designed to fit data, and in the third, the data was found to fit the equation.

In high school, I asked my stats teacher, and she didn't really give me an answer.

Here are two (related?) questions:

* 1) Out of a population of 1,276,645 there are 408,527 actions performed. Or, in other words, 32% of the population performs the action. Now a segment of the population is chosen which meets some criteria A: let's say 525,432. Out of this population, 131,358 perform this same action or 25%.

Are the actions performed by the entire population and the segment statistically significantly different? How do I calculate this?

* 2) I have two sets of impressions and clicks for two ad creatives being tested. A/B testing basically.

How do I calculate if the click through rates are statistically different?

My plan was to manually attribute a topic for a given amount of articles then write a script which would automatically classify other articles based keyword score.

For instance if I have an article who's top keywords are: ""machine learning"", ""artificial intelligence"" and I manually set the topic to ""Technology"" then those keywords would get +1 for technology.

The problem is whenever a new keyword appears, I won't be able to classify the article automatically as the keyword will be unknown to the system.
