When it comes to picking the right wireless charger for your Google Pixel phone, this simple business of choosing a wireless charger becomes super convoluted. See, Qi wireless chargers need to have EPP in order to be able to top up Pixels at 10W speeds or higher. Instead of fishing around for a compatible charger, most folks consider taking the easy route with Google's own Pixel Stand (2nd Gen). Although the 2nd Gen Google accessory is capable of recharging any Pixel device at its max supported wireless charging speed, it is stupidly expensive. iOttie's Made by Google certified iON Wireless Duo charger stand provides a much more affordable alternative that is guaranteed to work with your Pixel. Unlike the nearly $80 Pixel Stand (2nd Gen), the iON Wireless Duo charger stand costs around $50. That's a lot cheaper than Google's offering, and it doesn't stop there. Since this is a dual wireless charger, you get space to recharge two devices simultaneously with the iON Wireless Duo. Thus, the iON Wireless Duo charger stand also gives you a lot more value for money. iOttie used to make a standard version of the dual wireless charger, but that has been discontinued. So all iON Wireless Duo charger stands you see out there are Made for Google certified. This means Google has worked with them and vetted the product for surefire compatibility with its devices.  There are many reasons why we hold the iOttie iON Wireless Duo in high regard. It's certainly one of the best Qi wireless chargers out there for any Android phone. The fabric-covered stand supports 15W wireless charging for all Android devices, and it has a grippy silicone pad beside it so you can recharge your earbuds wirelessly at 5W. You could always put another phone on the 5W pad instead, and it would charge wirelessly as long as the phone's got the feature. Just for fun, I tried it with my Pixel 6, and it worked. However, it would take forever and be extremely inefficient. There are many reasons why we hold the iOttie iON Wireless Duo in high regard. Being able to wirelessly charge two devices at once it as pretty handy, especially if you tend to forget to plug in your devices at night. The iOttie iON Wireless Duo can be placed on a desktop or nightstand to ensure your phone is always charged. Because of the anti-slip fabric and silicone materials, you don't have to worry about your devices moving around, either. Apple users will be happy to hear that the iOttie iON Wireless Duo wireless charging stand also delivers 7.5W to iPhones wirelessly. Since we are an Android-only household, I didn't put this to the test, but I'm confident that it will work for any iPhone user. iOttie was clearly gunning for maximum convenience here because the charging stand comes with a power cord and adapter in the box. You don't have to purchase a separate USB-C cable or charging brick with specific power ratings and charging profiles, which is such a relief. However, I do wish that the connector on the power cord was something more standard. USB-C would have been more practical since you can easily replace that in the event that the propriety cable gets lost or damaged.  The iOttie iON Wireless Duo charger stand is perfect for Google Pixel users because they don't have to worry about charging specs or compatibility. This Qi wireless charger offers a simple plug-and-play experience. While I do wish that the stand itself could be tilted or adjusted to some degree, the overall value prospect is undeniable. You can charge two devices at the same time, the charger is sturdy and adds grip, and you get everything you need in the box. Plus, it works with all Android and iOS phones, albeit at different charging speeds. If you need a decent wireless charger for your Pixel 7 series, Pixel 6 series, or any other Pixel device, the iOttie iON Wireless Duo charger stand is perfect for your needs.   Perfected for Google With the iOttie iON Wireless Duo charger stand, you get guaranteed 15W wireless charging support for any Pixel device. As a bonus, you can charge another device on the side at 5W wirelessly. For the price, this is a well-made, high-quality product that touts loads of value.",en

At least 10 migrants have been killed and 25 others injured after a cargo truck clandestinely carrying them overturned on a highway in southern Mexico. The accident took place early on Sunday in the Mexican state of Chiapas near the border with Guatemala. A source in the prosecutor’s office who spoke on grounds of anonymity told AFP news agency the victims were apparently from Cuba and all were women, including one minor. The incident occurred on a stretch of highway along the Pacific coast between the towns of Pijijiapan and Tonala, where people often travel as they attempt to reach the United States. The truck, whose body was partially built of wood, was destroyed, with the migrants’ clothes, bags and backpacks strewn around it.      Thousands of migrants from different countries travel across Mexico in buses, trailers and freight trains as they head for the US. It was the second fatal crash in less than a week involving migrants in Mexico. On Thursday, two migrants died when a truck overturned in the municipality of Mezcalapa, also in Chiapas state.  In August, at least 15 people were killed when a crowded bus carrying primarily Venezuelan migrants and asylum seekers collided with a trailer on a highway in Mexico that connects the states of Puebla and Oaxaca, a route known to be used by migrant smugglers. In July, another bus in Oaxaca plunged off a steep road, killing as many as27 people. Another 18 people were killed in a crash in April. And in February, migrants from Venezuela, Colombia, and Central America were involved in a bus crash, again between Oaxaca and Puebla, that left at least 17 dead. Crashes are just one of the many perils migrants and asylum seekers face as they journey north to the US-Mexico border, a common destination. Many must also confront dangerous jungle passages, criminal gangs, and the risk ofextended detention.               Follow Al Jazeera English:",en

And if anything, you know, your book, this film, hopefully can be a reminder of what’s at stake, and it’s freedom,” the director of12 Years A Slaveand upcomingBlitzsaid Sunday as the film screened at theNew York Film Festival. The book refers to ‘Atlas of anOccupied City, Amsterdam 1940-1945’ by Bianca Stigter, McQueen’s wife, a filmmaker (Three Minutes: A Lengthening) and historian. Her Atlas is a compedium of addresses around the city where Nazi atrocities unfolded during World War II with descriptions of each. The couple lives in Amsterdam with their children. McQueen shot the film around the city over nearly three years, ending up with 36 hours of footage edited into just over four. There’s no archival footage but shots of building exteriors, parks, public gardens, underpasses, a girl’s school, a theater and other locations, some since demolished, that were sites of interrogation and execution. Instead, the camera lingers on modern day city dwellers going about their lives in the same spots.Related StoriesFestivalsFilm Festival Calendar Listings For 2023Breaking NewsAs Actors Strike Drags On, NY Film Festival Offers A Tale Of Two Premieres: 'Ferrari' Brings Adam Driver & Penélope Cruz, While 'The Curse' Duo Benny Safdie & Nathan Fielder Dodge Spotlight Some 60,000 of Amsterdam’s Jews were deported to concentration camps during the war as a strong Dutch Nazi party collaborated with occupying Germans. Holland deported more Jews proportionally (70%) than any other Western European nation and very few survived. “I don’t know if it’s a documentary. I don’t know if it’s a feature film. I don’t know if it’s art. I don’t know what the hell I was doing. I was not interested in the whole idea of framing the film as any kind of genre. All I wanted to do was to allow Bianca’s text to bring us to someplace, was to discover what we could discover in the moment of now, but reflecting on the past,” he said during a Q&A with Stigter and NYFF artistic director Dennis Lim. “At the end of the day, we didn’t know what we were going to get. And it was just a lot of faith in the process, and the film.” The doc premiered at Cannes.A24, which co-financed the film with New Regency, has domestic rights.Deadline review here. He said the concept had been percolating for years. “I remember walking on the street with Bianca when I first met her, and asking her, ‘What’s this monument for?’ And it was basically a monument  [on a site] where Nazi soldiers executed members of the resistance…So that sort of shocked me, it really kind of gave me a bit of a shudder. And then to discover that my daughter’s school and where kids were jostling, you know, putting their rucksacks into their lockers, this actual space, was where the SS had this sort of interrogation center.” Stigter, who is from Amsterdam, said her book focused particularly on “where the perpetrators were.” The Atlas is more like a guide book with picture and maps, street by street, neighborhood by neighborhood. The film is more a “wandering through the city.” On the length of the movie, which is shown with an intermission, McQueen said, “It’s about time, it’s about the weight of the subject. It deserves no less. This couldn’t be an hour-and-a-half movie, because it just had to have the weight of time.” “It’s more of an experience than a history lesson. And it doesn’t matter…if you wander off sometimes,” added Stigter.",en

Meanwhile, in other countries, governments keep functioning, even in the midst of wars and constitutional crises. So why does this uniquely American phenomenon keep happening? For most of the world, a government shutdown is very bad news - the result of revolution, invasion or disaster. That leaders of one of the most powerful nations on Earth willingly provoked a crisis that suspends public services and decreases economic growth is surprising to many. In a last-minute deal on Saturday, Congress's managed to avoid a shutdown by passing a stop-gap spending bill that will keep the government running for another 45 days. But that means the politicians will have to go back to the bargaining table, and the country could be facing another shutdown yet again, once the funding runs out. So why does this keep happening? America's federal system of government allows different branches of government to be controlled by different parties. It was a structure devised by the nation's founders to encourage compromise and deliberation, but lately has had the opposite effect.  That's because in 1980, the Attorney General under President Jimmy Carter's administration issued a narrow interpretation of the 1884 Anti-Deficiency Act. The 19th Century spending law banned the government from entering into contracts without congressional approval; for almost a century, if there was a gap in budgets, the government had allowed necessary spending to continue. But after 1980, the government took a much stricter view: no budget, no spending. That interpretation has set the US apart from other non-parliamentary democracies, such as Brazil, where a strong executive branch has the ability to keep the lights on during a budget impasse.  The first US shutdown occurred shortly after in 1981, when President Ronald Reagan vetoed a funding bill, and lasted for a few days. Since then, there's been at least ten others that led to a stop in services, lasting anywhere from half-a-day to over a month. The last one, from 21 December 2018 to 25 January 2019, was the longest on record. While some essential services did continue to run, like social security and the military, hundreds of thousands of federal workers were not paid. At the time, the White House estimated that the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points for every week the salary stoppage went on. Elsewhere in the world, such shutdowns are practically impossible. The parliamentary system used by most European democracies ensures that the executive and legislature are controlled by the same party or coalition. Conceivably, a parliament could refuse to pass a budget proposed by the prime minister, but such an action would likely trigger a new election - not a stoppage in services like national parks, tax refunds and food assistance programmes. That's exactly what happened in Canada in 2011, when opposition parties rejected the budget proposed by then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative Party, which had a minority of seats in parliament. The House of Commons then passed a motion of no-confidence, triggering an election. Meanwhile, the government's services ticked away. Even in Belgium, which did not have an elected government in power for 589 days between 2010-2011, the trains kept running.  More recently, Ireland managed to keep everything running from 2016-2020 under a minority government with a confidence-and-supply system, which is when parties not in power agree to support spending bills and confidence votes. But this type of cooperation has become increasingly rare in the US, where warring political parties seem all-too willing to use the day-to-day functioning of the government as a bargaining chip to extract demands from the other side. The latest shutdown, for example, is the result of a minority of hardline conservative Republican members of Congress demanding deep spending cuts that centrists in their own party and Democrats would not support. A deal was finally reached on Saturday, but with a huge caveat: no additional funding for the Ukraine war.  With the clock ticking on the 45-day stop-gap funding, it remains to be seen what kind of new deal will be reached - if one can be reached at all.",en

They are today's arrivals - around 150 - at a makeshift camp in the picturesque town of Oulx manned by local volunteers. They give out donated coats to the migrants to help them survive the mountain temperatures on the arduous journey ahead. For even here, having reached Italy from across Africa and the Middle East, these groups of mostly young men want to go on to France and beyond. More than 130,000 migrants have entered Italy this year - almost double the same period in 2021, following a surge of arrivals by boat to the southern Italian island of Lampedusa.  Numbers travelling north to the border with France have doubled in the past few months. But France's authorities are detaining and pushing back undocumented migrants, having reintroduced controls on its border with Italy, suspending parts of the Schengen free movement regulations.  The European Court of Justice recently ruled that the pushbacks breach EU law and that migrants detained should be subject to an official return decision, adding that forced removal should only be ""a last resort."" One of those trying to make the journey to France is Omar, from Nigeria, who spent months in Libya before paying smugglers the equivalent of $800 (£660) to make the dangerous trip across the Mediterranean to Lampedusa.  From there, he was moved to two camps elsewhere in Italy, before managing, he says, to get out and walk to the French border. Now his aim is to reach the UK. ""I just want to have a good life and study there,"" he tells me, his foot bandaged from an injury at sea. I ask whether he's seen pictures or heard stories of economic migrants being refused asylum in France or the UK and being sent back. He has, he says, but even if he meets the same fate, he will try again.  ""If I have to return to Nigeria, my parents will be so sad, because their dreams didn't become true,"" he adds. Some fail early. We watch as an Italian police car drives an Egyptian migrant back to the makeshift camp, caught before he could make the crossing.  But the checks on this side of the border are rare, with volunteer Elena telling me she's only seen it happen two or three times in the couple of months she's been there. So are the Italian police turning a blind eye, I ask? ""They know exactly what we're doing here, they know exactly what these people are here for, so it's like a game somehow,"" she says. ""They know, but they pretend not to know."" I put it to her that some would see her work as encouraging illegal migration. Just last week, the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hit out at Germany's government for funding NGOs that help migrants around Italy, denouncing them as ""a pull factor."" ""I don't care,"" Elena says. ""If you see somebody who needs something, and you know the risks in the mountains, can you allow people to walk like this? This is the responsibility of all of Europe."" After a short bus ride to the town of Claviere, the migrants reach the border. But, fearing police, most avoid the road up to the official crossing. Instead, they scatter into the forest, hiding and waiting to dash across the mountains, away from prying eyes. Shrouded in mist, and with temperatures dropping fast, the perilous rocky paths have already claimed several lives. Others search for alternative routes, four hours' drive south in the Italian coastal city of Ventimiglia, close to Nice.  Here, migrants camp out at the station, trying their luck on a cross-border train. But France's controls are stringent; we accompany French police who stop every train arriving from Italy, asking for identity papers from passengers and even checking toilets for stowaways.  In one carriage, a handful of Africans are caught without documents, led off to be sent back across the border to Italy, from where they will almost certainly try again. The rapid rise in migrant arrivals here is infuriating Ventimiglia's mayor, Flavio di Muro, from the far-right Lega party. He hits out at France's suspension of the Schengen free movement zone on this border, which has facilitated the checks and pushbacks.  ""The EU is not working,"" he laments. ""Each country is setting its own migration limits and Italy has to shoulder the burden alone. I've put armed guards in the cemetery because migrants were entering to spit on graves, urinate and vandalise the bathrooms,"" he claims.  ""We've reached our limit. We could become the Lampedusa of the north."" On the Alpine border in Claviere, the temperature is dropping fast as autumn wears on. At night, groups of migrants huddle together under the shelter of the church, some lighting a fire to help pass the hours until their attempt to cross the mountains undetected.  Red Cross workers come to distribute food and water - one telling me of migrants they found who needed their fingers amputated after catching frostbite.  Amid the forests of the Alps and the railways of Ventimiglia, a new bottleneck in Europe is emerging. And whatever the continent's leaders seem to do, the determination of the desperate is proving impossible to quash. ",en

Can it really? US President Joe Biden and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman upgraded their frosty relationship from an awkward fist bump last year to a firm handshake as they announced the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC). (Biden had once vowed to make Saudi Arabia a global pariah.) The project launched to bolster transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia through rail and shipping networks, while beneficial for the region, was also telling of American foreign policy, ""which, to put it simply, is anything that would further US interests against China,"" Ravi Agarwal, editor-in-chief of Foreign Policy magazine told the BBC.  America does not benefit materially from being part of the project, ""but this can be put in the category of the Japan-South Korea summit at Camp David,"" says Parag Khanna, author of Connectography. The US marked its diplomatic presence at the presidential country retreat by brokering a thaw in the relationship of the two pacific nations in the face of growing Chinese expansionism. The IMEC is also being seen by many as a US counter to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a global infrastructure-building project that connects China with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Russia and Europe. This year marks a decade since President Xi launched the BRI.  Some say the project's grand ambitions have dwindled significantly, as lending to projects has slowed down amid China's economic slowdown. Countries like Italy are expressing their desire to withdraw, and nations such as Sri Lanka and Zambia find themselves caught in debt traps, unable to meet their loan obligations. BRI has also faced criticism for numerous other reasons from its ""underlying objectives of gaining strategic influence through developmental footprint… aggressively linking different regions with Sino-centric value chains, inadequate attention to local needs, lack of transparency, disregard for sovereignty, adverse environmental impact, corruption, and lack of sound financial oversight,"" Girish Luthra, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation think-tank wrote in a recent paper. Despite the hiccups the Chinese have achieved a ""staggering amount"" and IMEC isn't even close to being a ""rival"" says Mr Khanna, adding that it can at best be a moderate volume corridor. ""It is not a game changer on the scale of BRI. It is a good announcement but you don't look at the proposal and say, oh my god, the world can't live without it,"" Mr Khanna told the BBC. You can see why.  China has a 10 year head-start with BRI with total investments under the initiative crossing an eye popping $1 trillion this July. Over 150 countries have joined as partners, which as Mr Luthra writes has significantly expanded its geographical scope ""from a regional to a near-global initiative."" IMEC isn't the first effort by the developed west to use infrastructure as a counter to contain China's growing footprint.  The G7 and US launched a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment in 2022, aiming to mobilize $600bn in global infrastructure projects by 2027. The Global Gateway is the EU's answer to BRI. Neither match its scale or ambition. However the fact that the past five years have witnessed a surge in these projects in response to China's initiative is evidence that BRI has been a ""global economic multiplier,"" says Mr Khanna. Some analysts caution against exclusively viewing IMEC through the lens of opposition to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), suggesting that such a binary perspective may not be fruitful. Its formation gives a further boost to the ongoing trend of transactional partnerships, where countries engage in collaboration with multiple partners simultaneously. ""Most countries these days tend to participate in multiple fora and alliances,"" says Ravinder Kaur, a professor at the University of Copenhagen. IMEC's memorandum of understanding document is thin on detail but an action plan is expected in the next 60 days. As of date all it has done is map out the potential geography of a corridor. Making it happen will be enormously complex. ""I'd like to see an identification of key government agencies who will underwrite the investments, the capital each government will allocate, and the time frames, says Mr Khanna. A new customs and trade architecture will also be need to be put in place to harmonise paperwork, he adds, giving the example of the Trans-Eurasian railway through Kazakhstan that passes through 30 countries. ""That transit is seamless. You need clearances only at the beginning and end of the journey. We don't have this with IMEC."" Then there are also the obvious geopolitical complexities of navigating ties between partner countries such as the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia who often don't see eye to eye. It wouldn't take very much for tactical cooperation of this kind to go awry, say experts. The IMEC will compete with the Suez Canal, the sea-level waterway in Egypt used to transport freight between Mumbai and Europe. ""To the extent IMEC improves our relations with the UAE and Saudi Arabia, it will hurt relations with Egypt,"" economist Swaminathan Aiyar wrote in his column for the Times of India. Transport by sea through the Suez Canal is also cheaper, faster and considerably less cumbersome. ""It may make excellent political sense, but it goes against all the tenets of transport economics,"" Mr Aiyar adds. But IMEC's ambitions transcend the narrow scope of trade and economics to include everything from electricity grids to cybersecurity - building on conversations that have taken place in security forums like the Quad, points out Navdeep Puri, a former Indian ambassador to the UAE in a column for The National News. ""If the lofty ambitions outlined in New Delhi can become a reality, they would make a singular contribution to a safer, more habitable planet. For now, let's live with that hope.""

Gandhi has evolved into a timeless idea, whose relevance goes beyond India, his country of origin. A global search has long been in progress to understand his values and ideals. The world will be a better place if we live up to his experiments with truth. I consider myself fortunate to have spent the first 14 years of my life with him – Gandhi was assassinated by Hindu fanatic Nathuram Godse in Delhi on January 30, 1948 – and in my advanced years, I am still coming to terms with his lofty values and ideals. To an impressionable young girl, who was unaware of the trappings of modern-day technology, gadgets and gizmos, he had tried to instill in me an inner quest for that elusive moment with truth in his inimitable ways. As a doting grandfather, he would often ask me how I was improving my handwriting, what new knowledge I had acquired, and whether I was doing my daily physical exercise. I continue to cherish those simple joyous moments of life. Gandhi’s is a celebration of an exceptional life: full of adventure. It was “Sattvik Shakti” (Sanskrit for pure spiritual energy). Even now, more than 75 years since his passing, I’m still possessed by his beatific smile and the inner strength of his spiritual energy. The world may like to remember him as an advocate of non-violence. But to my mind, he was a philosopher and spiritual leader, who selflessly dedicated his life to forging a consensus. The partition of the Indian subcontinent into two countries (India and Pakistan) at the stroke of a young nation’s independence in 1947 pained him immensely as he could not come to terms with the petty craving for power and wanton greed for materialism. It was a blow that he could never recover from till his tragic end. At the end of his life, Gandhi was disappointed. He felt that though India gained political independence from the British, the country was unable to eradicate deep-seated injustice. The trend holds true in this day and age. He was an internationalist, who had an exceptional ability to turn foes into friends like a clinical psychologist. He could read people’s minds with consummate ease while never, ever compromising his own conviction. Perhaps this fascinating strength of his character came into its own during his non-violent fight against colonial British rule through his civil disobedience movement, which had started in 1930. I have realized that Gandhi is a symbol of Everyman. He believed that non-violence and peace are a celebration of our consciousness to honor life and creation. This celebration of our consciousness should be translated into the objective of a people’s movement for cleaning the human mind of violence and protecting the environment from pollution. This celebration is a universal message that goes beyond social, political and religious divisions. For Gandhi, non-violence meant much more than just a lack of violence. Non-violence is an action and introspection. It is the courage of truth with love. It is the reawakening of the spirit in harmony with nature and environment and all forms of life, whose significance has acquired an all-new dimension amid the global conversation around climate action and sustainability. Consider his struggle for independence against the imperial British forces. It was the struggle of an ordinary colonized Indian in search of truth, liberation and independence. The genesis of his freedom movement, which appears to have been lost on many historians, is fundamentally rooted in economics. The British were busy plundering our wealth, such as textiles manufactured in our mills, which found their way to England while Indians continued to languish in poverty. This led to the revival of khadi – the handspun and hand-woven cloth – and has since emerged as the thread of creation. Through the decades, khadi has become a source of livelihood and a fashion statement to millions of Indians. The “charkha,” a hand-spinning wheel and a defining image of Gandhi, is also a meditational therapy. Now, the world again needs to get acquainted with the fabulous texture of the handspun fabric and the hand-spinning wheel. The “charkha” is also inseparable from Gandhi’s “satyagraha,” the policy of passive political resistance, which is epitomized in his mother power. He was a mother in a wider connotation of the word. He was a symbol of a common man, who through his extraordinary heroic deeds transformed into a larger-than-life power and an enduring symbol of empathy and compassion. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who had no love lost for Gandhi, had grudgingly described him as a “seditious Middle Temple lawyer” now “posing as a fakir” (an ascetic) at the Round Table Conference in England in 1931. Gandhi, who wore a loin cloth and wrapped himself in a white sheet, braving the cold weather in England, had elicited a snide remark from Churchill. However, his support for the poor, his encouragement of boycotts of British goods, and his wish to eradicate religious differences and class distinctions were lost on Churchill. Gandhi’s relevance would not have stood the test of time had it not been for his wife Kasturba, who predeceased him in 1944. At every stage of his life, Kasturba, who got married to him at the tender age of 13, questioned her husband’s moves. Her challenge strengthened his power of conviction, helping him to revisit his thoughts and ideals. Kasturba was his sounding board as a life partner. Gandhi also had a great ability to keep in touch with people in a technology-challenged age. He was a die-hard family man, who loved to spend time with his children, grandchildren, and loved ones, and also built a network of loyal supporters, ardent admirers and skeptics by keeping in touch with them through letters and word of mouth. The British underestimated the power of this “fakir” and bowed to his “satyagraha.” Gandhi’s ideals continue to inspire his followers and admirers – many of whom may not be acquainted with the intricacies of his fascinating life. I shall be in Arunachal Pradesh, the remote and largest northeastern state in the country, on October 2 to celebrate the 154th anniversary of his birth. I am going to visit Arunachal at the invitation ofRobin Hibu, the first Indian Police Service officer from the state, who plans to convert his residence into a Gandhi memorial museum. Such selfless acts of dedication and devotion show that posterity has not forgotten Gandhi’s values and ideals. And as long as people like Hibu are among us, the Gandhian way of life will continue to ignite young minds. (As told to Joydeep Sen Gupta, Asia editor)",en

In the last SEC Oversight hearing in Congress back in April, Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) had a contentious back and forth with Gensler with questions over the status of Ether as either a security or a commodity. This hearing saw a repeat of the wrangling back and forth but with questions over Bitcoin. Both times, Chair McHenry has chosen these questions to be the very first ones asked during the hearing. It appears the top two digital assets by market size, Bitcoin and Ether, are still creating consternation for policymakers as to the right regulatory approach. More importantly, the question as to whether action by Congress is needed to help provide a regulatory paradigm that consumers, investors, and businesses can rely upon when it comes to digital assets. WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 16: Committee Chair Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) presides over a House Financial ... [+] Services Committee at the Rayburn House Office Building on May 16, 2023 in Washington, DC. The committee held an oversight hearing on prudential regulators. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) To help get to the heart of the matter, I had a chance to speak to two of the top crypto attorneys in the space to help provide some insights on what the public heard regarding the status of Bitcoin and Ether. For Bitcoin, Gensler answered, “I would say it’s not a security and then the test is otherwise for other laws.” For Ether, Gensler’s answer was, “I am not going to speak about any specific one,” and that it is based on the facts and circumstances of each cryptocurrency token. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler testifies during a Senate Banking Committee ... [+] Hybrid hearing on 'Oversight of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,"" Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib) Lewis Cohen, co-founder of DLx Law, a boutique law firm focusing on clients active in the blockchain and crypto asset space, said “The SEC Chair seems reluctant to take on the question of whether ether is a security, not because there is doubt as to whether ether is a security (it is not) but because answering the question directly would then require grappling with many more difficult questions regarding other crypto assets. I asked H. Joshua Rivera, Operating Partner and General Counsel at Blockchain Capital, the first venture capital fund dedicated to crypto builders since 2013 with over $2 billion in assets under management, whether some of the reluctance in answering the question had to do with a regulatory turf war between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Rivera said, “I don’t know if it’s a turf war. What Gensler wants to do, he wants most people to believe that crypto assets in general are securities and therefore subject to SEC regulation.” Crypto Regulations: Clear As Mud Or Crystal Clear? Regarding Gensler’s refusal to answer the question on Ether, McHenry expressed the concern that the crypto industry is finding out as we go along due to all the numerous enforcement actions the SEC is issuing. McHenry then asked whether Gensler could at least agree there is a lack of clarity. Gensler would not, saying “I think the clarity is there.” Gensler has also said publicly many times that he has never seen an industry filled with as much noncompliance as crypto. However, is it the regulations are clear and there are all bad actors in the space, or is this industry that creates value like any other, with legitimate actors as well as its share of frauds and scams. Cohen says, “By pursuing enforcement actions against parties in the crypto space not accused of fraud or malfeasance, the SEC risks diluting their authority and provides the courts with an opportunity to second-guess the Commission’s extremely broad interpretations of the power granted to them by Congress. That is unfortunate.” Rivera said along this vein that Gensler, “... wants to fulfil an objective - bring the crypto under the SEC’s jurisdiction and slow the crypto industry down because it has accelerated so rapidly.” Rivera went on to note that, “ In any industry that creates value there is going to be fraud and scams. [Gensler] is less interested in collaborating with the industry to come up with sensible regulations.” Is It Time For Congress To Enact New Legislation For Digital Assets? When McHenry asked if a new law from Congress would help consumers to be better protected when dealing with Bitcoin, Gensler explained that while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has antifraud authority, the agency does not have plenary authority, or the ability to write rules to better regulate the digital asset marketplace, and that this would help them [the CFTC]. Currently, the bill in Congress farthest along that could establish a market structure for crypto and settle the questions on Bitcoin, Ether, and numerous other cryptocurrencies, the FIT For the 21st Century Act (H.R. 4763) has been voted out of both the House Financial Services Committee and House Agriculture Committee for consideration by the entire House of Representatives. McHenry has been driving the charge behind this legislation. When it comes to what kind of legislation might help the industry, Cohen said, “ I would like to see Congress adopt principles-based legislation that recognizes that investment schemes inherently involve fundraising and that non-fundraising exchanges of crypto assets in secondary market are not securities transaction unless the crypto asset is used to create legal rights or an interest in some identifiable legal entity.” Cohen went on to note, “It would also be good to see a bespoke disclosure regime adopted for crypto assets that are not securities.” As to Gensler’s acknowledgement that Congress could do something to help the CFTC, Rivera commented, “That recognition in and of itself is a tacit rebuke of Gensler’s position where he is basically of the opinion to let him go and regulate the crypto markets”. McHenry’s clash against what he describes as an SEC chair leading a ‘crusade against the digital asset ecosystem’ while Gensler continues to insist regulations are clear and it is an industry filled with noncompliance, leaves an ongoing debate in political circles that questions whether legislation is needed and what type of policy is best for all stakeholders in the new cryptocurrency ecosystem.",en

Having tested it myself, I did appreciate its wall-shattering demos and high-resolution passthrough. But what I'm most excited about is how developers can use the Quest 3 to make VR fitness training much more viable than before, thanks to mixed reality.  In his weekly column, our Senior Editor of Wearables and Fitness Michael Hicks talks about the world of wearables, apps, and fitness tech related to running and health, in his quest to get faster and more fit. One of the most popular use cases for the Quest 2 is at-home fitness, transporting you to fun worlds so you don't get bored burning calories. Meta literally had to fight the FTC to acquire Supernatural, a fantastic VR workout app, because the agency felt it would give the company a VR fitness monopoly and leave rivals scrambling to sell headsets without it.  I personally tested the Quest 2 as a main fitness device over the course of a month earlier this year. It ultimately didn't work for me because, well, I can burn more calories running, or even power walking, than with controller swipes and rapid movements within a narrow circle — without the constant fear of smashing into something because I don't have a large enough dedicated space for VR.  The Meta Quest 3 already solves that last problem. In a Meta Connect demo booth, I tested the new MR mode in Les Mills Bodycombat, one of our favorite Quest exercise games. It essentially preserves the front 180º FoV of the VR experience but keeps your back, sides, and ground visible via passthrough, so you're aware of nearby furniture and people with a quick glance.  When my head or hands drifted toward the front edge of my Guardian boundary, I instantly saw a clear view of the booth and Meta employee in front of me; once I withdrew, it returned just as quickly to a VR-only view. The new Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 and extra RAM, which makes Quest 3 games look so much better, also make passthrough more responsive. That, in turn, makes working out in VR much safer.   The initial wave of Meta Quest 3 games and enhancements, like Les Mills' limited MR and FitXR's VR-only Zumba studio, show the current limit for how far the Quest 3 can go to improve games that were designed for VR. The game design must create an immersive world that blocks out your surroundings, so you can't naturally incorporate MR into them except in the areas you don't normally look.  But brand-new mixed-reality fitness experiences are the one type of MR software that I genuinely hope could be better than the VR equivalent.  Why? Because when it comes to at-home workouts, there's only so much you can do in VR without spatial awareness of your floor and free hands. Fundamental HIIT moves like burpees don't work when the headset can't possibly track where the rest of your body will jut out of the Guardian barrier; you're liable to break something or hurt yourself with an ill-timed drop.  You can't safely hold and lift weights, even small ones, because you can't actually see them — and you're probably holding Touch controllers anyway.  The Quest 3 has a depth sensor for better hand tracking and visual recognition of how close or far you are from something. Crisp full-color passthrough ensures you can check where your yoga mat is before dropping down to do some push-ups — so long as you're careful not to smash the headset into the floor — or walk over to your weight rack and grab the right size. And it even has better venting than the Quest 2 to hopefully prevent your face from getting too sweaty. My main question is whether or not the Quest 3's built-in accelerometer or cameras have the smarts to recognize specific body-weight workout motions like a fitness smartwatch can. But in theory, you could follow a fitness training video in the headset and see real-time heart rate data and your current score in the corner as you switch between punching targets and completing planks and crunches. My second question: will developers make mixed-reality-only experiences? Because the Quest 2's black-and-white passthrough falls short of the Quest 3 with 10X fewer pixels, an MR exercise app would be both nauseating and unsafe, defeating the purpose. So, any MR exercise app couldn't target the 20 million Quest 2 owners out there. So, really, whether or not the Quest 3 lives up to its MR potential as a cross-training tool depends on how well it sells since a larger audience incentivizes developers to target it alone. For now, my hope is that Meta is already taking advantage of its Supernatural ownership to start making its own Quest 3-exclusive MR workouts.   The Meta Quest 3 beats the Quest 2 in key ways: it's 40% skinnier, has 2X the graphical power, has 30% higher display resolution with 25% better sharpness, 10X the passthrough resolution, and a more comfortable facial interface with more room for air circulation. ",en

Dozens of Russians from family to former fighters have held memorial services for Wagner mercenary group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin to mark 40 days since his death, hailing him as a hero of the people. Prigozhin was killed when his private jet crashed on its way from Moscow to St Petersburg on August 23, two months after he led afailed mutinyon Moscow. Two other top Wagner commanders, Prigozhin’s four bodyguards and the plane’s three crew were also killed in the still-unexplained crash.  At the 62-year-old’s grave in St Petersburg, his mother, Violetta, and his son, Pavel, laid flowers. Supporters waved the black flags of Wagner which sport a skull and the motto “Blood, Honour, Motherland, Courage”. In the Eastern Orthodox church, it is believed that the soul makes its final journey to either heaven or hell on the 40th day after death. Memorials also took place in Moscow and other Russian cities with dozens of Wagner fighters and everyday Russians paying their respects. There was no coverage on Russian state television or any official tributes. Wagner fighters have played a key role in the fighting in Ukraine, helping Russia capture the eastern town of Bakhmut in May after weeks of bruising battles. Wagner, whose troops were moved to camps in Belarus as part of a deal to end the mutiny, was also active in a number of African countries. “He can be criticised for certain events, but he was a patriot who defended the motherland’s interests on different continents,” Wagner’s recruitment arm said ofPrigozhinin a statement on Telegram. “He was charismatic and importantly he was close to the fighters and to the people. And that’s why he became popular both in Russia and abroad.” Prigozhin’s mutiny, which followed months of expletive-laden videos insulting Russia’s top military officials, was arguably the biggest challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule since the former KGB spy rose to power in 1999. The Wagner troops took over the southern city of Rostov, shot down several Russian aircraft and advanced towards Moscow before turning back 200 km (125 miles) from the capital following a purported deal brokered by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. Mourners spoke of respect for Prigozhin, who got to know Putin while running a restaurant business in St Petersburg in the 1990s. He went on to win lucrative state catering contracts earning him the nickname, “Putin’s chef” and expanded into media as well as an infamous internet “troll factory” that led to his indictment in the United States for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Wagner brought him further into the limelight with themercenary groupdeveloping a reputation for brutality and ruthlessness. “He was a real authority, a leader,” Mikhail, a soldier in Russia’s armed forces who refused to give his second name, told the Reuters news agency. Moscow resident Marta, who also refused to give her surname, said the people believed in Prigozhin but that Wagner had been “decapitated” by the deaths of him and co-founder Dmitry Utkin, a former special forces officer and aNazi sympathiser. Prigozhin was also supposed to have moved to Belarus as part of the deal to end the mutiny. Russia looks set to continue using Wagner units despite the recent turmoil. On Friday, the Kremlin said Putin had told Andrei Troshev, one of Wagner’s top commanders, that he should “deal with forming volunteer units that could perform various combat tasks, primarily in the zone of the special military operation” – a term Moscow uses for its war in Ukraine.

The accident took place in southern Chiapas state, near the border with Guatemala, the report said. A source in the prosecutor's office, who spoke on grounds of anonymity, told AFP the victims were apparently from Cuba and all were women, including one minor. The accident occurred on a highway along the Pacific coast between the towns of Pijijiapan and Tonala, where migrants often travel as they attempt to reach the United States -- part of a flow drawing increasingly urgent attention in Washington. The truck, its body built partly of wood, was destroyed, with the migrants' clothes, bags and backpacks strewn around it. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel lamented the tragedy and said the Mexican embassy was offering assistance. ""We urge you to use established, safe and orderly routes when emigrating,"" he told Cubans looking to leave their country. On Thursday, two migrants died when a truck overturned in the Chiapas municipality of Mezcalapa. Thousands of migrants from different countries have been traveling across Mexico in cramped buses, trailers and freight trains -- or on foot -- in an attempt to reach the United States. In early August, at least 18 people died and another 23 were injured after a bus with local passengers and migrants from countries such as India, the Dominican Republic and some African nations plunged into a ravine in the state of Nayarit. This weekend, in the northern states of Chihuahua and Zacatecas, nearly 3,000 migrants were stranded in isolated areas when the freight trains they were traveling on inexplicably stopped. Mexican authorities said they detained more than 189,000 migrants last month, while the US border patrol has reported 1.8 million apprehensions between October 2022 and August 2023. With the influx of migrants ""overwhelming"" Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has called on his US counterpart for ""help."" On Friday, Washington and Mexico City pledged to redouble their efforts to strengthen economic and security cooperation on migration issues, as well as drug and arms trafficking. Republican lawmakers in Washington have grown increasingly angered by the migrant arrivals and have called on President Joe Biden's administration to do more to address the issue. After passing a last-minute measure on Saturday to avoid a US government shutdown, Republican leaders expressed a willingness to block any additional funding for Ukraine's war effort unless more is spent on the border. ""I'm going to make sure that the weapons are provided for Ukraine,"" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, ""but they're not going to get some big package if the border is not secure."" He did not define what it would take for him to consider the border as being ""secure.""",en

But one thing we often forget is the attitude with which we begin this journey of self-improvement and fitness. The right attitude can make a huge difference. Changing your attitude towardsweight losscan definitely lead to positive outcomes. Setbacks and struggles are normal during your weight loss journey, but a positive mindset can ease the pathway. So, recently, nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar took to Instagram to share three attitude changes we must make during our weight loss and fitness journey to make it “healthy and happy”. First, the nutritionist said that if one meal gets messed up, don’t mess up the whole diet. “Stop being angry and disappointed on yourself. You don’t need to give up your diet for the entire day just because one meal went wrong. You can get on track with your next meal. That’s the only way to repair things. (sic)” Next, she pointed out that one should stop following the all-or-nothing rule for exercise. “Even if you are unable to do a full60-minute exercise, it does not mean you don’t exercise at all. We think that 20 to 30 minutes of exercise is of no use. This attitude prevents us from losing weight. So, next time, keep in mind that it doesn’t matter how long you exercise. The best workout is the one that gets done.” Additionally, Diwekar recommends never asking anyone else how you are looking physically because if they give a negative response, you will feel demotivated. “Remember, this is a journey and not a destination, so support yourself, be loving and forgiving on this journey to achieve good health!” she said.   A post shared by Rujuta Diwekar (@rujuta.diwekar) Concurring with the above, Ruchika Jain, chief clinical nutritionist, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj said that individuals need to have a strong mind to continue theirweight loss journey.“It doesn’t matter how many obstacles you have. If you have made up your mind, you will be able to do it. You can practice yoga to keep your mind concentrated.” She added that once you have started the journey, checking your weight every day is not helpful as it will demoralise you. “Instead, measure it on a weekly basis at the same time every week to feel a significant weight loss.” In a similar vein, Fareesa Fatima, senior clinical nutritionist, Fernandez Hospital noted that to preventyo-yo dietsor fleeting goals, target gradual weight loss rather than aiming to lose a lot of weight in a very short period of time. Agreeing, Dr Latha Sashi, chief nutritionist & head, clinical nutrition & dietetics, Fernandez Hospital suggests setting realistic goals. “Initially, target a decrease of 10 percent weight of your present weight.” Apart from this, the experts recommended to avoidskipping mealsand follow a regular eating pattern. “Most people think that weight loss means eating less, which is not true. The food that you eat, enjoy it to the fullest and relish it slowly. Since you are changing your habit of eating, you must be mindful of what you eat,” Jain said. It is important to note that a weight loss journey is not to make you weigh less, but instead helps you find inner happiness. “Weight loss takes time, so be patient and stay committed to your goals. Consult a registered dietitian to help you achieve your weight loss goals in a healthy and sustainable way,” Fatima concluded. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!",en

In March, the three countries announced details of the so-called Aukus pact to provide Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines by the late 2030s. The pact aims to counter China's ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region. Beijing has strongly criticised the three countries over the deal. ""We're incredibly proud of our role in the delivery of this vitally important, tri-nation submarine programme,"" BAE Systems chief executive Charles Woodburn said. BAE said the funding will pay for development work to 2028, with manufacturing of the vessels expected to start towards the end of this decade. The first SSN-Aukus submarine is scheduled to be delivered in the late 2030s. Both the UK and Australia will use the SSN-Aukus submarines, which will be based on a British design. ""This multi-billion-pound investment in the Aukus submarine programme will help deliver the long-term hunter-killer submarine capabilities the UK needs to maintain our strategic advantage and secure our leading place in a contested global order,"" UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said as the Conservative party conference got under way in Manchester. BAE said the SSN-Aukus will be the biggest, most powerful and advanced attack submarine ever operated by the Royal Navy and will eventually replace the Astute class, which it builds at its site in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The agreement will provide decades of work at the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard, where it employs more than 10,000 people. The company said the deal will also fund significant investment at the site, investment in its supply chain and recruitment of more than 5,000 workers. BAE employs 39,600 people in the UK and has a global workforce totalling more than 93,000, according to the company's website. Other major UK defence contractors are also getting a boost from the Aukus deal. In March, it was confirmed that Rolls-Royce Submarines would provide all the nuclear reactor plants that will power the SSN-Aukus vessels. In June, Rolls-Royce said it would almost double the size of its Raynesway facility in Derby as a result of the deal. On Sunday, Babcock International, which maintains and supports the UK's submarines, said it had signed a five-year deal with the Ministry of Defence to work on the SSN-Aukus design. The Aukus security alliance - which was first announced in September 2021 - has repeatedly drawn criticism from China. However, the three Western countries say the deal is aimed at shoring up stability in the Indo-Pacific.",en

The awards, … [+4381 chars]",Antarctica,"Narcolepsy, cancer or mRNA vaccine research could win the Nobel Medicine Prize on Monday when a week of announcements kick off, but experts see no clear frontrunner for the Peace Prize. The awards, first handed out in 1901, were created by Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel in his 1895 will to celebrate those who have ""conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."" The Medicine Prize is first out, and will be announced in Stockholm on Monday around 11:30 am (0930 GMT), followed by the awards for physics on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Peace Prize, the most highly-anticipated Nobel and the only one announced in Oslo, will follow on Friday, before the Economics Prize rounds things off on October 9. The Medicine Prize has over the years crowned groundbreaking discoveries like the X-ray, penicillin, insulin and DNA -- as well as now-disgraced awards for the lobotomy and the insecticide DDT. Several Nobel watchers have suggested this year's prize could go to research into narcolepsy and the discovery of orexin, a neuropeptide that helps regulate sleep. It could also go to Hungarian-born Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman of the United States for research that led directly to the first mRNA vaccines to fight Covid-19, made by Pfizer and Moderna. Their discovery has already won a slew of major medicine prizes, but the Nobel committee nowadays often waits decades to bestow its laurels to ensure the research stands the test of time. ""Maybe the Academy thinks it needs to look into it more, but someday they should win,"" predicted Annika Ostman, science reporter at Swedish public radio SR. But Ostman said her guess for this year was on Kevan Shokat, an American biologist who figured out how to block the KRAS cancer gene behind a third of cancers, including challenging-to-treat lung, colon, and pancreatic tumours. T-cell therapy for cancer treatment and work on the human microbiome could also be contenders, said David Pendlebury, head of the Clarivate analytics group which identifies Nobel-worthy research. ""There are more people deserving of a Nobel Prize than there are Nobels to go around,"" he told AFP. Lars Brostrom, Ostman's colleague at SR, singled out two American biologists, Stanislas Leibler and Michael Elowitz, for their work on synthetic gene circuits which established the field of synthetic biology. It enables scientists to redesign organisms by engineering them to have new abilities. But Brostrom noted the field could be seen as controversial, raising ""ethical questions about where to draw the line in creating life"". For the Physics Prize, twisted graphene or the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica were seen as possible winners, as well as the development of high-density data storage in the field of spintronics. For Wednesday's Chemistry Prize, Pendlebury suggested next-generation DNA sequencing could get the nod, or research into how to target and deliver drugs to genes. Brostrom said he would love to see it go to US-based chemist Omar Yaghi for his work into porous materials known as MOFs, which can absorb poisonous gases or harvest water from desert air, and is an ""important field for the future"" with enormous potential for the environment. Criticism over a lack of gender and geographical diversity has plagued the Nobels over the years. US-based men have dominated the science fields, while women account for just six percent of overall laureates -- something the various award committees insist they are addressing. Among the names making the rounds for Thursday's Literature Prize are Russian author and outspoken Putin critic Lyudmila Ulitskaya, Chinese avant-garde writer Can Xue, British author Salman Rushdie, Caribbean-American writer Jamaica Kincaid and Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse. But for the Peace Prize, experts have been scratching their heads over possible winners, as conflicts rage around the globe. Some have pointed to the Iranian women protesting since the death in custody a year ago of Mahsa Amini, arrested for violating Iran's strict dress code imposed on women. Others suggest organisations documenting war crimes in Ukraine, or the International Criminal Court, which could one day be called upon to judge them. ""I think that climate change is a really good focus for the Peace Prize this year,"" Dan Smith, the head of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, told AFP after a year of extreme weather around the world. For the Economics Prize, research on income and wealth inequality could be honoured.",en

The United Kingdom has awarded three UK companies a 4 billion pound ($4.9bn) contract to design and manufacture a nuclear-powered attack submarine as part of the country’s AUKUS programme with Australia and the United States. The UK Ministry of Defence, in a statement on Sunday, said the contract with BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Babcock “represents a significant milestone for both the UK and the trilateral AUKUS programme as a whole”. The new submarines, known as SSN-AUKUS, “will be the largest, most advanced and most powerful attack submarines ever operated” by the Royal Navy and will “combine world-leading sensors, design and weaponry in one vessel”, it said. The first of the submarines will be delivered into service in the UK in the late 2030s and the first Australian ones will follow in the early 2040s. Theplans for SSN-AUKUSwere unveiled in March by the leaders of Australia, the UK and US and came as the three countries ramp up their efforts to counter China in the Asia Pacific region. The nuclear-powered vessels – which have far greater stealth and range and mark the first time Washington has shared nuclear-propulsion technology with a country other than the UK – represent a significant upgrade to Australia’s current diesel-powered fleet. Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles previously described the AUKUS deal as “the biggest step forward in our military capability that we’ve had since the end of World War II”. Under AUKUS, Washington also intends to sell Canberra up to five of its Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines in the early 2030s. It will also see US and UK submarines deployed in Western Australia as soon as 2027 to help train Australian crews. Analysts say the AUKUS programme will strengthen deterrence in the face of China’s increasingly assertive actions in the Pacific, including in theSouth China Seawhere it has built military bases on disputed outcrops and reefs. “As highly stealthy platforms, SSNs’ ability to operate in contested waters, hunt Chinese warships and submarines, control strategic sea lanes and chokepoints, and project power with long-range cruise missiles make them one of the most effective ways to complicate Chinese military planning and give Beijing a reason to take pause before using force,” wrote Ashley Townshend, a senior fellow for Indo-Pacific security at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, in a commentary in March. “The fact that US, UK, and, in time, Australian SSNs will be operating as a combined force—with Aussies also embedded on American and British subs—raises the specter of horizontal escalation by forcing Beijing to consider the prospect that military action against any SSN, or the submarine base itself, could trigger the involvement of all three nations,” he added. China has meanwhile condemned AUKUS as an illegal act of nuclear proliferation. Its foreign ministry has accused Australia, the UK and US of travelling “further down the wrong and dangerous path for their own geopolitical self-interest”.

A Reuters poll of economists had expected a rate of 2.20 per cent following August's inflation rate of 3.27 per cent. The September inflation rate was the lowest since February 2022. Core inflation also eased to 2.00 per cent from 2.18 per cent a month before, compared with the poll's prediction of 2.08 per cent. Inflation in Southeast Asia's largest economy peaked near 6 per cent in September of 2022 after the government raised subsidised fuel prices. That bump last year left prices at a high base that contributed to the low reading for the month just ended. To control inflationary pressures, the central bank raised interest rates by a total of 225 basis points between January and August. Bank Indonesia's (BI) inflation target is a range of 2 per cent to 4 per cent for this year. The target will be lowered to 1.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent next year. ""The sharp deceleration in Indonesia's September inflation was along expected lines and driven purely by base effects,"" said DBS Bank economist Radhika Rao. ""The BI will take comfort from easing inflation,"" she said, although Rao expected no immediate policy easing due to the rupiah's weakness against the U.S. dollar. Despite headline inflation staying within target, annual rice inflation accelerated in September, with retail prices rising 18.44 per cent from a year earlier, faster than in August. At rice milling and wholesale levels, prices were up 27.4 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively, on a yearly basis. The statistics bureau blamed the rising prices for rice - a food staple for most of Indonesia's population of 270 million - on tight supplies as drier-than-usual weather hurt harvests across the country.

Experts urge thatamla, rich in antioxidants, is a must-have in your diet. Ushakiran Sisodia, HOD, diet and nutrition, Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital said thatamlaor the Indian gooseberry boasts of several benefits as it is rich in iron and vitamin C. “If the tangy flavour doesn’t suit your palate, consider mixing it into a morning juice with a spoonful of honey, or sprinkling its powdered form over salads and smoothies,” said Sisodia. For those who prefer the flavour, traditional pickled amla, mixed with spices, can be a welcomingaddition to meals. “No matter how you choose to consume it, ensure it becomes a part of your diet to harness its numerous health benefits. Moderation is key, so a piece of amla or a small glass of its juice daily will be enough,” said Sisodia. Notably, amla aids healthy bowel movement by keeping the gastrointestinal tract clean. “This prevents common digestive issues including constipation. Acidity and indigestion can also be controlled with amla. A half teaspoon of amla powder with a glass of warm water can give some relief,” ayurvedic practitioner Dr Dixa Bhavsar toldindianexpress.comin an earlier interaction. What more? One can consume it raw, in pickled form, as a dried powder, or as a homemade sweet concoction. As such, nutritionist Juhi Kapoor also articulated a few ways in which amla can be included in one’s diet. “Add tosalads, raita, make chutney or pickles, or use as powder or juice,” Kapoor said. You can also quickly whip up a dip with it like Kapoor did. Kapoor shared the recipe for a tasty coriander amla chutney prepared with fresh amla and a bunch of coriander leaves. Ingredients 2 cups – Coriander leaves6 no –Amlas2 no – Red chillies1tsp – Cumin seeds1tsp – Salt (or to taste)2tbsp – PeanutsWater as required Method *In a mixer jar, pulse to smoothen all the ingredients.*Store in an air-tight glass container. How long can you store it? A week, Kapoor said in the comments section.   A post shared by Juhi Kapoor (@thejuhikapoor) Why add peanuts to the mixture?

 Finlands right-wing government is … [+6822 chars]",Finland,"Finland’s right-wing government is facing an autumn of discontent as trade unions and students put pressure on it over cuts to social welfare, the erosion of employment rights and job security, and new restrictions on international students who want to stay in the Nordic nation. Trade union leaders have branded Prime Minister  Petteri Orpo ’s government a 'reverse Robin Hood administration' slashing benefits for the poor while rewarding the rich with tax cuts. The most visible recent protests began with students occupying Helsinki University, a movement now entering its third week for which a thousand university staff members have signed a  letter of support . Organisers say the movement has “spread like wildfire” to every other major university in the country. ""We support the students’ views, and the University leadership understands the occupiers’ concerns about the livelihood of students,” says Vice-Rector Kai Nordlund in a  statement . Students say they've endured enough cuts, and a line must be drawn.  ""During the last decade the welfare support that Finnish students receive has been constantly cut, and this government is continuing that, worsening the situation for students and forcing us to take on more debt in order to study which means when we graduate we have a huge amount of debt to pay off,” says Havu Laakso, one of the  students occupying Helsinki University. Laakso and their compatriots start the week with a boost to morale after a standoff with authorities, which ordered them out before Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö was due to speak at a recent event in the building. At the eleventh hour the university capitulated and the students, whose ranks had swelled with the prospect of forced eviction, managed to make plenty of noise during Niinistö’s speech. “This current government also wants to increase tuition fees and tighten immigration policy making it so that international students only have three months to find a job once they graduate, or they get kicked out,” Laakso tells Euronews. Experts have been baffled as to why the current government would cut housing allowances, while at the same time needs to attract thousands of foreign workers to fill traditionally low-paid jobs like nursing and elderly care - workers who rely on exactly these sorts of benefits to make ends meet; and also why there would be such a tight timeline imposed on international graduates whose skills are needed if Finland wants to be one of Europe's most innovative and tech-lead economies.  Politicians weigh in on the protest action Over the weekend one politician from the ruling National Coalition Party ratcheted up the rhetoric by framing the students as ‘left-wing invaders’ who were unreasonably demanding more grants and allowances from the state; while opposition politicians from the Social Democrats questioned why members of parliament were willing to make welfare cuts, but not willing to go to the protest and explain why they were doing it, face-to-face. Sandra Bergqvist , Finland's Minister for Youth, tells Euronews she understands why the students are concerned: ""When your wallet shrinks, you react.""  ""The right to demonstrate is fundamental to the Finnish society. However, we must keep in mind that enrolling in higher education is free for Finns, in comparison with countries where already tuition fees might be significant,"" she says. Bergqvist, from the Swedish People's Party, points out that the government currently provides students with an education grant, housing benefits, subsidised meals and a student loan guarantee scheme. ""But in this demanding economical situation where the goverment's finances need to be adjusted, a larger part of the financial support to students will be loan-based,"" the minister adds.   What would Jesus do? Finland's churches get involved Meanwhile a  Helsinki parish church  described it as “ungodly” to cut money from already low-income and disadvantaged people, and the official  Turku Cathedral  social media accounts posted a similar message of support, saying ""caring for your loved ones is part of the Christian faith, regardless of party affiliation.""  The 'occupy education' strikes have even spread to some Finnish high schools, first in the capital region and now several other cities, as the union representing high school students encourages its teenage members to speak up. “There are a lot of protests taking place everywhere around the country, and I think the government will have to pay attention, but I’m not too hopeful they will change,” the union's chairperson  Ella Siltanen  tells Euronews. Government's attempts at labour market reform Alongside cuts to student benefits and tighter immigration measures, the government is also proposing some of the widest reforms to the labour market in decades, and while experts agree that Finland’s social security system and labour market regulations are ripe for overhaul, Finns are reluctant to embrace wholesale change. A previous attempt at sweeping reforms in the early 1990s fell by the wayside after unions threatened a nationwide general strike; and more recently, the introduction of a so-called ‘activation model’ to get people off benefits and into employment introduced by PM Juha Sipilä’s government in 2018 was met with widespread protests, as it essentially punished unemployed jobseekers who couldn't find work.  The deeply unpopular activation model was largely rolled back by the next, left-wing, government after it was revealed more than 90,000 people had their benefits cut. Unions launch three weeks of targeted strike action The current government swept into office on a promise to limit government borrowing, and rein in what they viewed as the ‘profligate’ spending of the Sanna Marin administration. But they’ve already blown through their own €10 billion borrowing limit, and are now acquiring debt at the same rate as Marin’s government, putting to rest any lingering notion that the fiscally conservative National Coalition Party is somehow naturally better at handling the economy than its left-wing counterpart the Social Democrats. “I think we have to go back to the 1990s before we had this kind of government,” explains  Jarkko Eloranta , the President of the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions  SAK . “This is not an austerity budget the government has introduced, because they are giving tax relief for the most wealthy, like lowering taxes for people earning more than €80,000 per year,” he tells Euronews. “This is a reverse Robin Hood government, it takes from the poor and gives to the rich so in that sense it is only an austerity budget for low-income people."" As part of the wider protests, Eloranta’s SAK has announced three weeks of targeted strike action in different sectors, and in different parts of the country. The union is flexing its muscle, hoping to give the government a taste of what could happen if they don’t walk back some of the policies that unions find problematic. “Of course we have other plans ahead if the situation continues, and I am quite sure the government is not shaken or backing down due to our current activities,"" says Eloranta, hinting at the possible escalation of strike action.  Finnish  media reports  that Minister of Finance  Riikka Purra , leader of the far-right Finns Party, has refused to meet with senior trade union leaders since taking office in June.  “The government says they are listening but there’s no real discussions, no real negotiations, they are just implementing their own policies,"" says Eloranta.",en

California Gov… [+2295 chars]",History,"A strategist who runs an organisation devoted to electing Democratic women who support abortion rights is to replace US senator Dianne Feinstein, who died last week at the age of 90.  California Governor Gavin Newsom appointed 44-year-old Laphonza Butler to the role.  She will be the only black female in the Senate, and the first LGBTQ+ person to represent California in the chamber. Ms Feinstein, a trailblazer for female politicians, was the oldest senator. Under Californian law, the governor can appoint a senator until the next state-wide election. The state will then hold two concurrent Senate elections in 2024: one special election to finish out Ms Feinstein's term, which ends in January 2025 and the regularly scheduled election for the US Senate seat for a six-year term, ending in 2031.  Ms Butler is the first black woman to lead EMILY's List. Before she started the role in 2021, she was a senior campaign adviser to US Vice-President Kamala Harris during her 2020 presidential bid. Ms Butler has also worked as director of public policy at Airbnb and as a union leader. Mr Newsom said she will be the first black lesbian to openly serve in the US Senate.  In a statement, the White House said it respects the governor's decision to appoint Ms Butler as a replacement for Ms Feinstein.  Last month, prior to Ms Feinstein's death, Mr Newsom pledged to appoint a black woman to serve the remainder of Ms Feinstein's term - until elections take place in November 2024 - should the post become vacant. However, he said he hoped that it was a decision he would not have to make. Political watchers had expected Gov Newson to appoint a replacement quickly, as Ms Feinstein's death split the Senate evenly between Democrats and Republicans.  With Ms Butler's appointment, the Democrats have regained their wafer-thin majority.  Ms Feinstein had previously announced plans to retire at the end of next year, but resisted growing calls for her to step down. Several prominent Democrats, including Congress members Adam Schiff and Katie Porter, have previously said they will run for her Senate seat. In a statement after her death, US President Joe Biden said that Ms Feinstein ""made history in so many ways, and our country will benefit from her legacy for generations"". Earlier this year, she was absent from Capitol Hill for nearly three months following a case of shingles. She took on lighter duties upon her return and moved around the US Capitol using a wheelchair. She sometimes seemed confused during interviews, and in committee hearings or floor votes. Ms Feinstein was well known as a vocal advocate for gun control measures, and an ardent supporter of the assault weapons ban signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994. As a senator, Ms Feinstein was the first woman to chair the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee, where she led a years-long review of the CIA's controversial interrogation programme of foreign terrorists in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in 2001. The review ultimately led to legislation barring the use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" such as waterboarding on terrorism suspects.",en

They say it's necessary, given the ongoing migration crisis facing the EU. But what will this mean for Romania and Bulgaria, … [+4577 chars]",Bulgaria,"One of the main principles of the Schengen Agreement is citizens' freedom of movement, meaning no controls at the group's internal borders.  However, there are clauses in the treaty that provide for the temporary reinstatement of border controls, primarily when there is a threat to public order or internal security. In 2023, at least seven Schengen states resorted to those provisions.  ""The  Schengen Borders Code  allows Member States to reintroduce border controls in the event of a serious threat to their national security, provided the measure is necessary as a last resort and is temporary. Now the Schengen states interpret these conditions very broadly,"" says  Eugenio Cusumano , Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Messina.  According to Cusumano, in this situation, a ""domino effect"" is created, where the state's neighbours follow its example. ""The reinstatement of border controls is used as a signal to the public - the government is tough on migration,"" Cusumano says, noting that this is a very attractive strategy at a time of rising populist sentiment.  ""What we are seeing now is another example of the fragility of the Schengen zone. Germany and now other member states are reinstating border controls. This is happening for several reasons, including political ones. In particular, it has to do with the upcoming elections at local and national levels, putting pressure on central governments,"" says  Alberto-Horst Neidhardt , head of the migration programme at the Centre for European Policy.  It is also linked to the arrival of large numbers of migrants in southern European countries, he said. Thanks to the lack of borders, refugees move freely across the continent, and some EU countries have seen a sharp rise in asylum applications in recent months. Germany in particular.  Berlin attributes the resumption of border checks with Poland and the Czech Republic to its fight against human traffickers. Slovenia is stepping up surveillance of its border crossings with Croatia, which recently joined the Schengen zone. ""Often it is only a question of spot checks. They only stop a fraction of the people crossing the border. This is not really a full restoration of internal borders. It is a symbolic measure. The Schengen system is perfectly fine. This is one of the greatest achievements of European integration,"" political scientist Eugenio Cusumano is convinced.  The Schengen Agreement was signed by five countries - France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg - in June 1985. It took place on the ship Princess Marie-Astrid on the Moselle River, near where the borders of Luxembourg, France and Germany converge.  The treaty was named after the nearest settlement - Schengen.  It was later joined by almost all the countries of the expanding European Union, as well as Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.  Ireland could not join Schengen because of a separate agreement with Great Britain. Two EU countries - Bulgaria and Romania - have been waiting for more than 15 years to be allowed to join the Schengen group. Some analysts say this will happen before the end of 2023. ""Million dollar question"": when Sofia and Bucharest will become part of Schengen The European Parliament has repeatedly urged the governments of the group's countries to authorise Bulgaria and Romania to join Schengen as soon as possible, noting that they have already fulfilled all the necessary requirements.  In September, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, delivering her State of the Union address, said it should be done ""without further delay"". ""This is of course the million-dollar question, and I'm afraid I don't have a crystal ball to predict when it will happen,"" said Alberto-Horst Neidhardt of the Centre for European Policy. And politics ""again plays a big role in this issue,"" Neidhardt says. ""All new EU members should be able to enjoy this privilege, a stronger and more sustainable Schengen system."" ""For a long time, it was thought that they were not yet ready and there was a long way to go. But in fact, it looks like they will be part of Schengen by the end of 2023. This could probably be achieved sooner, but at least they are already on that path,"" political scientist Eugenio Cusumano told Euronews. New members need a vote in favour from all countries in the group to be included in Schengen.  The Netherlands and Austria are blocking Bulgaria and Romania from joining, saying they are part of the so-called 'Balkan Route' through which a large number of migrants enter the EU. ",en

Michael Lewistalked about Bankman-Fried's relationship with Brady during aninterviewon ""60 Minutes,"" which aired on Sunday. Lewis's book on the rise and fall of Bankman-Fried's FTX, ""Going Infinite,"" is set to be published on Tuesday. Lewis told ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Jon Wertheim that he thought Brady ""adored"" Bankman-Fried. ""I think Tom Brady thought he was just a really interesting person. I think he liked to hear what he had to say,"" Lewis said of the pair's relationship. Lewis, who has penned books on finance such as ""The Big Short"" and ""Flash Boys,"" told ""60 Minutes"" that he thinks the feelings were mutual. ""And he really liked Tom Brady. And Sam wasn't, like, a big sports person,"" Lewis continued. ""So it was funny to watch that interaction. It was like, 'These two people actually get along.' It's like the class nerd and the quarterback."" Lewis said in the interview that Brady struck an unlikely friendship with Bankman-Fried despite the latter's nerdishness. ""Like, even the nerds don't hang out with this nerd, he's such a nerd,"" Lewis said. ""The quarterback somehow likes him. And he somehow likes the quarterback."" A representative for Bankman-Fried declined to comment on Lewis' remarks. Bankman-Fried wascharged in December 2022and accused ofillegally funneling millions of dollars from FTX customer funds into his trading firm, Alameda. Lewis said Brady was deeply upset after witnessing Bankman-Fried's fall from grace. ""He clearly really liked him. And he really liked the hope that he brought,"" Lewis said of Brady. ""And Brady was I think crushed. And I think as time has gone by, and he's ceased to get a really good explanation about what's happened-- I think he's just like, 'He tricked me. I'm angry. I don't wanna have anything to do with it anymore,'"" Lewis told CBS. Brady had served as ahigh-profile brand ambassadorfor the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, appearing inthree FTX commercials. The football star ownedmore than 1.1 million FTX shares. The true extent of his losses is unknown because FTX was privately held, but Brady's stake was estimated byForbesto be worth around $45 million.

A powerful processor is absolutely a must for doing heavy tasks and so are long battery life and a great display which help reduce eye strain. A solid keyboard is also necessary if not a must. If you plan to use the laptop for programming, here are five laptops we think you should consider. If you are a serious coder in need of a highly reliable yet powerful notebook for coding, then the newApple MacBook Pro (review)with M2 Pro or M2 Max is clearly one of the best options to consider. As one expects from a professional lineup of laptops, the new MacBook Pro is the best in the business. It offers a great display, excellent computing power, and everything one seeks from a high-end notebook for coding.Depending on your preference, you can either opt for the more compact 14-inch or the larger 16-inch model, which also offers slightly better speakers and battery life. The price starts at Rs 199,900. Light coders can consider the MacBook Air instead of the MacBook Pro. The newM2 MacBook Air (review) is clearly one of the thinnest 13-inch notebooks in the market that delivers stellar battery life and it is also available in a 15-inch form factor. It also offers a great display, a premium build, and a Thunderbolt cable USB-C port with support for fast charging. It can be charged with most USB-PD compatible chargers. Just like every modern MacBook, the Air has an excellent keyboard and glass trackpad. The new Apple Silicon also helps this notebook deliver almost 10 hours of battery life along with silent operation for around Rs 100,000. On the Windows side of things, the Dell XPS 15 is a great choice. Just like the MacBooks, the XPS offers a premium design, and great battery life, and is powered by a 13th GenIntelCore H-series processor with excellent single-thread and multi-thread performance. This helps coders compile and run even the largest programs without any hassle. It starts at Rs 260,000, which is slightly on the expensive side. ThinkPad series of notebooks are known for their reliability, and the latest ThinkPad X1 Nano Gen 3 combines the legacy of the brand with up-to-date specs. This laptop, powered by the 13th Gen Intel Core processor, offers up to 64 GB of RAM and 2TB of internal storage. The notebook also comes with a 13.3-inch display (with or without touch). This portable notebook is both secure, with added software and hardware-based security protocols, and easy to carry around, making it a great machine for hybrid coders for around Rs 158,000. The HP ZBook Studio G9, with its desktop-class graphics and large 16-inch screen, is a great laptop for coders who work on large files requiring graphics rendering. This notebook comes with business-specific features and added security features that help secure the contents of the laptop even if it’s stolen, using self-healing BIOS technology. Priced at Rs 220,000, this laptop with a dedicated graphics card is meant for app and game developers.",en

India  suffered a setback in its neighboring nation, the  Maldives  as  Mohamed Muizzu , a candidate backed by  China , emerged victorious in the presidential runoff held recently, defeating the pro-India incumbent President Ibrahim Solih. This outcome comes after the initial polls on September 9, in which no candidate managed to secure the required 50% plus 1 vote for a presidential victory. Who is Mohamed Muizzu? Mohamed Muizzu currently holds the position of Mayor in Male and enjoys the support of former Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen, who is widely seen as having close ties with China, making him a significant figure in the Indian Ocean nation. It's worth noting that Yameen, who is presently serving a jail sentence, played a crucial role in the Indian Out campaign, which had garnered substantial attention and support from the opposition. Consequences of Muizzu's Victory Several factors appear to have contributed to President Solih's defeat. These include perceived failures in combating corruption, a sluggish approach to infrastructure projects, and differences with former President Mohamed Nasheed. Nasheed had previously broken away from the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) to establish his own political party. Despite last-minute efforts to reconcile Solih and Nasheed, no agreement was reached, and Nasheed chose not to endorse either candidate in the runoff. Significance of this Development Mohamed Muizzu had accused President Solih of compromising the Maldives' independence and sovereignty by seeking India's endorsement for every major decision. Shortly after President Solih assumed office in 2018, India pledged assistance amounting to $1.4 billion for various projects in the Maldives, including the flagship Greater Male connectivity project. Potential Implications While Muizzu has stated that his government will not hinder projects beneficial to the Maldivian people, it raises concerns about the future of the defense and security partnership with India. During his tenure, former President Yameen had requested the removal of Indian navy helicopters and personnel from the Maldives. Muizzu has indicated a willingness to take a similar stance. India's involvement in the Maldives extends beyond military exercises, maritime domain awareness, and the provision of hardware and infrastructure development. It also encompasses initiatives like the Coastal Radar System (CRS) and the construction of a new defense ministry headquarters in the Maldives. In the wake of these developments, the outcome of the Maldivian presidential runoff has introduced a new dynamic in the region, impacting India's strategic interests and its relationship with the Maldives. The ramifications of this shift will undoubtedly be closely monitored in the coming months. Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

Early voting has begun in parts of Australia for a landmark referendum on creating anIndigenous body that can advise Parliamenton matters affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. People eligible for early voting in the Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia will be able to cast their ballots from Monday, while voters in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory will be able to do so from Tuesday. The referendum itself is scheduled for October 14, and voting is compulsory. As early voting began, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hit the streets of Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, to rally support for the “yes” vote. “I sincerely think the key to the next fortnight is those one-on-one conversations with people to accept this request of the overwhelming majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,” he told reporters. The proposal asks Australians whether the country’s constitution should be altered to enshrine an Indigenous advisory body called the “Voice to Parliament”. Supporters say embedding the “Voice” in the constitution would recognise Indigenous people’s special place in Australian history while giving them input into government policies. Opponents argue it would divide Australians along racial lines without reducing the severe inequalities faced by Indigenous people.      The proposal, backed by Albanese’s Labor government, has beenstruggling to get majority support, with recent opinion polls showing voters will reject it. A survey published by the Australian Financial Review on September 25 showed that support for the “Voice” hadfallen to 33 percent, down by 15 points since May. The “no” vote was at 50 percent. Some voters who had switched their stance said the Voice was a distraction from their two biggest concerns – the cost of living and the price of housing. But Albanese said he remained optimistic that the proposal would pass despite the poor showing in polls. Volunteers for the Yes Campaign were also out in Melbourne, with officials saying there was still a chance to turn public opinion around. “As with any election, Australians tend to really put their focus into their decision-making much closer to the vote, so 12 days out, there’s plenty of time for us to have that conversation,” Dean Parkin, the director of the Yes23 Campaign, told Sky News. “There is a very clear choice in this referendum, a ‘yes’ vote gives us real recognition and a chance for practical change, whereas a ‘no’ vote gives us absolutely nothing,” he added. Australia has no treaty with its Indigenous people, who make up about 3.2 percent of its 26 million population. They were marginalised by British colonial rulers and are not mentioned in the 122-year-old constitution. They remain the most disadvantaged group in the country. Indigenous people have a life expectancy of about eight years less than non-Indigenous Australians and suffer disproportionately high rates of suicide, domestic violence andimprisonment. The “yes” campaign faces significant odds. A referendum to change the constitution requires what is known as a double majority – the support of most Australians nationwide plus a majority of voters in a majority of states. Of the 44 referendums held since the constitution took effect in 1901, only eight have been carried and none since 1977. Five referendums have failed because while they were supported by most Australians, they fell short of gaining majorities in at least four of the six states.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",en

With a top speed of 350 kilometres (220 miles) per hour, the bullet train ""Whoosh"" can get between the capital Jakarta and Bandung in 45 minutes. The 140 km journey would previously have taken about three hours by train. ""The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train marks our efficient, friendly, and integrated mass transportation system,"" Widodo said during a ceremony at the capital's central station. ""It is a symbol of our modernisation in the public transport, seamlessly connecting with other modes of transportation."" Widodo said the 600-capacity train was the first high-speed rail transportation in Southeast Asia. It is part of Beijing's Belt and Road initiative -- a decade-old programme of China-backed infrastructure projects. The president said the name was actually an acronym, standing for a tagline of ""Waktu Hemat, Operasi Optimal, Sistem Handal"" -- which in Bahasa Indonesia means ""Saving time, optimal operation, reliable system"". It was built by PT KCIC, which is made up of four Indonesian state companies and Beijing's China Railway International Co. The project was initially set to cost less than $5 billion and be completed by 2019. However, delays caused by construction challenges and the Covid-19 pandemic led to a surge in costs. In preparation for its opening, officials have conducted public trials for the new high-speed route. Last week, Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi confirmed that the government would extend the high-speed train route from Bandung to the country's second-biggest city Surabaya. Last month, Chinese Premier Li Qiang joined Senior Minister Luhut Pandjaitan on a ride aboard the train during his Jakarta visit for summits with Southeast Asian leaders. Pandjaitan told reporters on Thursday that Widodo plans to welcome Chinese President Xi Jinping in the future to ride the train, but did not give more specifics.",en

Less than a month earlier, Vladimir Putin had said in St Petersburg, at the Russia-Africa summit, that it was urgent to fight against the neo-colonialism of Western countries.  Wagner guns for hire have been involved in shady business on the African continent for years. So h as Prigozhin's demise jeopardised Russia's  plans  for the African continent? ""Prigozhin was a CEO, which means that the organisation functions independently of him, as does the entire infrastructure around the organisation, for which Africa is essential in terms of financing, money laundering and so on,"" explained Yan St-Pierre, an expert at the independent geoeconomic think tank Eastern Circles. ""All that infrastructure is still in place,"" he added. Pauline Bax, from the International Crisis Group, points out that ""Russian military officials, from the deputy defence minister to intelligence officers, have come to visit some of these countries. In the Central African Republic, Mali, there were contacts with the leaders of Burkina Faso, and it was made clear that the Russian Ministry of Defence was going to take control of the Wagner group."" Less than 1% of foreign investment in Africa comes from Russia Before being  diplomatically isolated  following his decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022, Putin's Russia was making ambitious promises to Africa.  At the first summit with African leaders in Sochi in 2019, the Russian president guaranteed that he would be able to double the volume of trade between the two blocs in five years. Not only did it not happen, it actually decreased.  In fact, Russia is not channelling much capital to Africa. In total, it accounts for less than 1% of foreign direct investment on the continent.  Trade stands at around €16 billion, which is around 5% of what the European bloc invests. More than two-thirds of exports (mainly cereals) are centred on just four countries: Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and South Africa. But when it comes to arms sales, it's a different story. By 2022, Moscow would have overtaken Beijing as the main arms supplier to Africa, accounting for almost  40 per cent of the total . The equipment is more affordable than Western equivalents and is compatible with material that has survived from the Soviet era.  This summer, in the space of just one month, there were two coups d'état - in Niger (26 July) and Gabon (30 August). Right next door, the examples are repeated: Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Sudan, and Chad; almost all of them on the sub-Saharan transition line.  Moscow: the realistic alternative to the West At a time when power transitions are taking place with weapons, the question arises: are Russia's targets purely  geopolitical ?  ""Much of what Russia and the Wagner group have done in the last two years, to put it bluntly, has been to show the middle finger to France. France has been the main target. They've targeted former French colonies in Africa. And it's worked surprisingly well. However, Russia doesn't make investments, it doesn't help development, it doesn't provide humanitarian assistance,"" says Pauline Bax.  For Yan St-Pierre, ""the fact that they support the dynamics of young people, saying 'we support what you do and we won't judge you if there are human rights abuses', stands out"". This is well received. What Russia does well is provide an alternative to what Western countries offer or have offered in recent decades."" By taking influence away from the West, Moscow is gaining support that is in short supply on the international scene. African countries have 54 votes in the UN General Assembly, making them one of the strongest regional blocs. ",en

At least 10 people, including three children, have been killed and dozens more injured in Mexico after the roof of a church came crashing down during a baptism ceremony, according to local officials. The incident occurred the northeastern coastal town of Ciudad Madero in the Tamaulipas state on Sunday. Working under floodlights, military personnel supported emergency services using rescue dogs and earthmoving equipment to identify and dig out survivors from the ruins of the church. “Unfortunately, 10 people are confirmed dead. Of these, five are women, two men and three children,” Americo Villarreal, governor of Tamaulipas, told reporters at the scene. Rescue workers were attempting to recover the body of a woman from the rubble, but the death toll was not expected to rise as all of the missing had been accounted for, he added. At least 60 people were treated for injuries, Villarreal said, with 23 were still in hospital. “Two have serious injuries, their lives may be in danger,” he added. Jose Armando Alvarez, the bishop of the local diocese, said in a video posted on social media that “the roof of a church has collapsed during the celebration of the Eucharist”. Several ambulances, patrol cars, and police and military personnel were at the site, in addition to numerous people in search of family members who were in the church. Local media showed footage of dozens of people trying to hold up part of the collapsed structure with poles while others made their way through the wreckage in search of survivors. Rescuers could be seen raising their fists in the air as a call for silence so they might hear any calls for help coming from people stuck under the wreckage. The Archdiocese of Mexico posted a message on social media offering condolences. “We join in prayer with our sister diocese Tampico to intercede for our killed and injured brothers,” it said. Local residents put out calls on social media asking for tools to aid the rescue effort, such as hydraulic lifts, wood and hammers. Ciudad Madero is a town of just more than 200,000 people on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.          Follow Al Jazeera English:",en

Ms Alegre, a human rights lawyer and author based in London, says shutting off in this way enables her to better concentrate, because it stops her from getting distracted. ""I think it's incredibly hard by willpower alone to have a smartphone and not waste a significant amount of time on it,"" she says. The app Ms Alegre uses is called Freedom. You can choose to block specific social media sites and websites, or turn off internet access entirely. You pick how long you want the blocking to last for in hours and minutes. You can subsequently change your mind about this, and cancel it early. Or alternatively, you can tick the ""locked mode"" button, which then means that your block cannot be overridden until the time you scheduled is up. Ms Alegre adds that she uses the Freedom app, as opposed to simply turning off her handset, ""when I need to be contactable on the phone, but I really don't want to be distracted"". Similar blocking apps now include ColdTurkey, FocusMe and Forest. With the proliferation of social media platforms and devices vying for our attention, a growing number of people are looking for ways to help them resist the urge to continually check notifications and scroll through social media feeds.  This has seen a surge in popularity this year of an approach to productivity called ""monk mode"". This involves dedicating yourself to a single task with no tech or other distractions. The term has gone viral on TikTok, where videos marked with the hashtag #monkmode now have more than 77 million views, up from 31 million in May. Ms Alegre credits the Freedom app with helping her focus on writing her book, a work of non-fiction appropriately entitled Freedom To Think, which was published last year. ""Ironically, my book is precisely about the challenge of focus in the digital age, and the way tech is designed to engage with our minds and interfere with our thought process,"" she says. Switching off from social media and the internet in general is not easy though, says Grace Marshall, an author and productivity coach. She points to the numerous studies in recent years that highlight their addictive nature.  ""You get a ping on a device and it creates an open loop,"" says Ms Marshall. ""Our brain wants to close that loop by looking at the notification because we get a dopamine [a natural chemical released in the brain that makes you feel good] hit when we close that loop."" Ms Marshall adds that interruptions from work emails can also problematic. ""Tech is instant, with emails, and [apps like] Slack, Microsoft Teams, and messages. Often people feel like there's an expectation to be instantly responsive."" She believes that in order to protect people's work-life balance, workplaces should establish guidelines around expected response times to messages or emails. ""It's not just about the focus and productivity aspect, it's also about the mental health impact,"" says Ms Marshall. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. The founder of the Freedom app, Fred Stutzman, says he got the idea when he was at university and found himself spending too much time on Facebook and not enough time on his dissertation. The app now has more than 2.5 million users around the world. He says ""it's not some sort of failing of our human capabilities"" that so many of us can't resist constantly checking our social media feeds.  ""Meta [the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp] employs hundreds of PhDs and behavioural scientists to make the app more stimulating. That's not a fair fight for the average person."" Mr Stutzman adds that he is pleased to ""use technology to push back against technology"".  Freedom says it saw a big jump in users during the pandemic, with downloads jumping by 50% in 2020, and 500,000 new users joining in 2021. The social media sites that are most blocked are said to be Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. If you don't want to rely on apps to boost your focus, Mark Channon, a productivity and mindset coach, advises making small changes in your daily routine to begin with. ""If you want to create change and habits, make the behaviour tiny,"" he says. ""If you don't want to watch YouTube, create other habits that are good for you. Being able to manage distractions is key. After you sit down at your laptop in the morning ask yourself 'what is the most important thing for me to complete today?', and listen to that answer."" Vladimir Druts, co-founder of FocusMe, believes social media addiction should be taken more seriously. ""Society focuses on drug addiction or gambling. But I think a lot of time we don't know we are addicted to our devices and our digital crutches."" Mr Druts sees monk mode as a movement against an increased desire for instant gratification.

And by releasinggreenhouse gassesinto the atmosphere, these fires in turn contribute to global warming, in a vicious circle.Another particularity of this northern forest: it releases 10 to 20 times more carbon per unit of burned area than other ecosystems.That's helped Canada's emissions reach unprecedented levels, at 473 megatons this year. That's more than three times higher than the previous record, according to data from Europe's Copernicus observatory.And in the boreal forest, due to the thickness of the humus on the ground, fires can continue to burn for months.""When we explain to people that the fires will only really be extinguished with snow, everyone becomes eager for winter to arrive,"" Guy Lafreniere, the mayor of Lebel-sur-Quevillon, a small Quebec town of 2,000 residents who had to evacuate twice this summer, says with a smile.Homes were saved thanks to the nearby lake which halted the advance of the fire.

The trees are too young to have had time to form cones which ensure the next generation,"" says Maxence Martin, a professor of forest ecology at the University of Quebec in Abitibi-Temiscamingue.In this remote region, forestry is the main industry, supporting entire towns with the 60,000 direct and indirect jobs linked to it. But both the industry and the wildfires have significantly reshaped the landscape.Some 18 million hectares (nearly 70,000 square miles) of land was torched this year in Canada's largest ever fire season.Losing one third of forest""If we continue on the current trend (of fires), by 2100 as much as one third of theboreal forestin Quebec will have been lost,"" says Martin, slaloming among the regrowth starting to poke through the scorched ground.This area is part of a vast ring of greenery which encircles the Arctic, stretching from Canada through Alaska, Siberia and northern Europe to form the largest expanse of wilderness in the world.Fires here are fueled by drier and hotter conditions caused by climate change. And by releasinggreenhouse gassesinto the atmosphere, these fires in turn contribute to global warming, in a vicious circle.Another particularity of this northern forest: it releases 10 to 20 times more carbon per unit of burned area than other ecosystems.That's helped Canada's emissions reach unprecedented levels, at 473 megatons this year. That's more than three times higher than the previous record, according to data from Europe's Copernicus observatory.And in the boreal forest, due to the thickness of the humus on the ground, fires can continue to burn for months.""When we explain to people that the fires will only really be extinguished with snow, everyone becomes eager for winter to arrive,"" Guy Lafreniere, the mayor of Lebel-sur-Quevillon, a small Quebec town of 2,000 residents who had to evacuate twice this summer, says with a smile.Homes were saved thanks to the nearby lake which halted the advance of the fire. But the whole summer was disrupted, no child finished theirschool yearand hundreds of small chalets built in the forest for weekends and vacations were destroyed.Today the city is surrounded by fire breaks, built during the blazes. A ring of conifers—which are very flammable—were chopped down.""We had a helicopter dumping water on the machines as they moved along chopping down the trees, so the machines didn't themselves catch on fire,"" the mayor recalled.Canada's fires were fueled by drier and hotter conditions caused by climate change -- and by releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, these fires in turn contribute to global warming.OverwhelmedMuch of Canada, including the far north, is facing extreme drought conditions. Lightning storms earlier this year were triggering hundreds of fires in a single day.Firefighters, authorities and residents were overwhelmed and declared emergencies persisting through the summer.""People had five minutes to leave their homes and hit the road. It was intense and stressful, especially since there was a lot of smoke and we could see the flames very close,"" says Doris Nolet, in charge of volunteer firefighters from Normetal, another evacuated Quebec village.""It was the first time that we were faced with forest fires. We know how to take care of houses, car fires, but not forest fires,"" she adds.""We had a strange summer,"" confirms Omer Riviere, who lives in this village and remains traumatized at having lost his chalet in theforestwhere ""he had old furniture and, above all, so many memories.""For the first time in its history, almost all Canadians were affected by this year'sfireseason, either directly or because they had to deal with the smoke, which traveled thousands of miles—repeatedly polluting the air across North America and even parts of Europe.""We need to think deeply. It's not Europe here, we don't have the means to fight all the fires. They are too far away, too big, too inaccessible—so we have to be proactive,"" suggests Natural Resources Canada's Marc-Andre Parisien.While the mega fires of 2023 are now smoldering, they'll almost certainly be back again.© 2023 AFPCitation:

Text exchangesfrom March last year revealed that philosopher Will MacAskill — an advisor to Bankman-Fried — relayed his interest to Elon Musk and tried to set up a meeting between the two. The text messages were part of the discovery process in Musk'scourt battlewith Twitter. In April last year, Musk's former partnerGrimes texted Muskthat Bankman-Fried would be willing to contribute up to $5 billion to Musk's acquisition of Twitter. FTX and Bankman-Fried were not listed as investors inMusk's funding dealto acquire the social media company. Bankman-Fried currentlyfaces chargesof wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering — which he has pled not guilty to. His trial is due to begin onTuesday, the same day that Lewis' book hits store shelves. The former FTX CEO had hisbail revokedin August over alleged witness tampering. Prior to his dramatic fall from grace, Bankman-Fried was once among the biggest names in crypto, with a net worth of$26.5 billionin 2021 according to Forbes. A representative for Bankman-Fried declined to comment to Insider. Elon Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Insider, sent outside regular business hours.",en

Harutyunyan led the breakaway region, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but was largely populated by ethnic Armenians, between May 2020 and the beginning of September. Less than a month later, the separatist government said it would dissolve itself by the end of 2023 after a three-decade bid for independence. Azerbaijani police arrested one of Harutyunyan's former prime ministers, Ruben Vardanyan, on Wednesday as he tried to cross into Armenia along with tens of thousands of others who fled following Baku's 24-hour blitz last week to reclaim control of Nagorno-Karabakh. Harutyunyan and the enclave's former military commander, Jalal Harutyunyan, are accused of firing missiles on Azerbaijan's third-largest city, Ganja, during a 44-day war in late 2020, local media reported. The clash between the Azerbaijani military clash and Nagorno-Karabakh forces led to the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in the region. The arrest warrant announcement by Prosecutor General Kamran Aliyev reflects Azerbaijan's intention to quickly and forcefully enforce its grip on the region following three decades of conflict with the separatist state. While Baku has pledged to respect the rights of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, many have fled due to fear of reprisals or losing the freedom to use their language and to practise their religion and cultural customs. In a briefing Sunday, Armenia's presidential press secretary, Nazeli Baghdasaryan, said that 100,483 people had already arrived in Armenia from Nagorno-Karabakh, which had a population of about 120,000 before Azerbaijan's offensive. Some people lined up for days to escape the region because the only route to Armenia — a winding mountain road — became jammed with slow-moving vehicles. A United Nations delegation arrived in Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday to monitor the situation. The mission is the organisation's first to the region for three decades, due to the ""very complicated and delicate geopolitical situation"" there, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters Friday. Local officials dismissed the visit as a formality. Hunan Tadevosyan, spokesperson for Nagorno-Karabakh's emergency services, said the UN representatives had come too late and the number of civilians left in the regional capital of Stepanakert could be ""counted on one hand."" ""I did the volunteer work. The people who were left sheltering in the basements, even people who were mentally unwell and did not understand what was happening, I put them on buses with my own hands and we took them out of Stepanakert,"" Tadevosyan told Armenian outlet News.am. ""We walked around the whole city but found no one. There is no general population left,"" he said. Armenian Health Minister Anahit Avanesyan said some people, including older adults, had died while on the road to Armenia as they were ""exhausted due to malnutrition, left without even taking medicine with them, and were on the road for more than 40 hours."" Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan alleged Thursday that the exodus of ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh amounted to ""a direct act of an ethnic cleansing and depriving people of their motherland."" Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry strongly rejected Pashinyan's accusations, saying the departure of Armenians was ""their personal and individual decision and has nothing to do with forced relocation."" In Athens, Greece, several hundred Armenians gathered Sunday evening outside the Greek Parliament to protest the upcoming dissolution of Nagorno-Karabakh - or Artsakh, as they called it in the banners they carried, in Greek and English. They then marched to the European Union offices, a few blocks away. The protest was peaceful.",en

Allegations against Kitagawa, who died in 2019, came into prominence again after a BBC documentary inspired more victims to come forward. In September, an independent inquiry concluded that the music mogul had abused hundreds of boys and young men over a six-decade career. It also urged compensation for victims. The Johnny & Associates agency on Monday revealed 478 people had responded to a website it had set up for recompense- 325 of whom were seeking compensation as victims. The agency said 150 of these people were former talents.  The pop agency renamed itself -SMILE-UP- and said the newly named entity would deal solely with identifying and compensating victims. A new company will be created to manage the talent.  The agency has said it will determine financial pay-outs for each victim on a case-by-case basis. Earlier this year the agency had apologised to victims and following the inquiry's findings, the then chief executive Julie Fujishima - Kitagawa's niece- stepped down.  She has been replaced by Noriyuki Higashiyama, a television star and singer in Japan who has also been accused of sexual misconduct - allegations he denied on Monday. ""I have never sexually harassed anyone. Some people may have felt I was power-harassing them, but it was 35-40 years ago, and I probably wouldn't have been able to understand what sexual abuse is,"" he said. Upon taking the leadership mantle in early September, Higashiyama said the agency was not sure if it would depart from the Johnnys name.  The restructure is believed to be an attempt to win back public acceptance - major Japanese companies such as Nissan, Asahi and Suntory dropped the agency's talent after the inquiry. The Kitagawa scandal in Japan has drawn comparisons with Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein who was convicted of rape and sexual assault. However Kitagawa never faced criminal charges and he remained a revered figure until his death at age 87 in 2019 - with his passing also drawing public condolences from Japan's prime minister at the time. The J-pop industry titan was seen as one of the richest and most powerful men in Japan. For decades, he was responsible for launching the country's most famous boybands and artists. His abuse was also considered an open secret in Japan's music industry. He faced allegations for much of his career and some cases against him were even proven in civil court-  however he also successfully sued for defamation over those reports and always denied wrongdoing. Most mainstream Japanese media also did not cover the allegations for decades, prompting accusations of an industry cover-up. Then in March, the BBC's documentary Predator: The Secret Scandal of J-Pop which detailed Kitagawa's abuse was aired, sparking national discussion and calls for a full investigation. Several victims told the BBC they thought their careers would be harmed if they did not comply with Kitagawa's sexual demands. The broadcast led to more victims coming forward - including a former J-pop idol Kauan Okamato- who deliberately held his press conference at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Tokyo for international media. He revealed he had been sexually abused by Kitagawa for four years, from the age of 15. He and several other victims spoke out after the resignation of Ms Fujishima last month. Her resignation also marked the agency's first public acknowledgement of Kitagawa's crimes. One man who identified as a victim spoke at a press conference held by the Johnny's Sexual Assault Victims' Association. ""I've learned that if you decide to act, you can change things. We don't have to walk looking down - we can look forward,"" he said.",en

The strongly-worded rebuke came after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted a resolution on Friday, urging North Korea to suspend its nuclear weapons program and heed the UN Security Council's resolutions. Reacting to the measure early Monday, a spokesman for Pyongyang's Ministry of Nuclear Power Industry vowed, ""As long as tyrannical nuclear weapons of the US and imperialist aggression forces exist on this land, the DPRK's position as a nuclear-weapon state will remain unchanged and the DPRK will never tolerate the hostile forces' acts of infringing upon its sovereignty."" The unnamed spokesman was using the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Noting that the IAEA has no jurisdiction in North Korea because it left the organization in 1994, the spokesman described the resolution as a ""result ofconspiracy"" by the United States and its allies. He emphasized that North Korea's status as a nuclear-weapon state has already become ""irreversible."" The spokesman also accused IAEA chief Rafael Mariano Grossi of ""taking the lead in creating the atmosphere of pressurizing the DPRK"" by ""spreading a false story"" about an imminent nuclear test. ""If the IAEA wants to avoid international criticism as a paid trumpeter of the US, it would be well advised to devote itself to tackling the difficulties facing the international community,"" the spokesman said, referring to US nuclear proliferation and Japan's discharge of wastewater from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant. ""Such farce of the hostile forces is a revelation of their sinister intention to cover up their criminal acts of seriously threatening the international nuclear nonproliferation system and justify their hostile policy toward the DPRK,"" he added.

In Kazakhstan on Tuesday, he met with officials including Deputy   Foreign Minister Roman Vassilenko, Deputy Defence Minister Lieutenant   General Sultan Burkutbayevich Kamaletdinov and members of the Committee   on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Security of the Mazhilis of Parliament,   to discuss future cooperation on peacekeeping missions. The Minister   also welcomed Kazakhstan's support for the sanctions regime against   Russia in response to the war against Ukraine. For over 20 years, the UK has assisted Kazakhstan in building the   capability of the Peace Operations Centre (KAZCENT), helping to enable   Kazakh deployments on peace support operations such as the UN missions   in CĂ´te d'Ivoire, Lebanon and Western Sahara. These efforts have been   underpinned by military English language training delivered by the UK. The minister then travelled to Uzbekistan on Wednesday, where he held   regional security talks with the Minister of Defence, Lieutenant   General Bakhodir Kurbanov, as well as the Commander of the National   Guard, General Rustam Jo'rayev, and Special Representative of the   President of Uzbekistan for Afghanistan Ismatulla Irgashev. He also laid   a wreath at the Victory Park in Tashkent to pay tribute to Uzbek   soldiers who lost their lives in World War Two. His visit concluded in Mongolia, where he became the first British   defence minister to visit the country. He met Defence Minister GĂĽrsediin   Saikhanbayar and discussed cooperation on peacekeeping missions. The UK   and Mongolia have an especially close relationship: our soldiers have   served together in Afghanistan and as peacekeepers in South Sudan, and   2023 marks the 60th anniversary of the UK becoming the first Western   country to forge diplomatic relations with Mongolia. My visits this week form part of the approach outlined in the   recent Defence Command Paper as we build our strategic international   partnerships across Asia, in the interests of security and prosperity   for everyone. I've held productive discussions with defence   ministers and military leaders in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Mongolia,   laying the groundwork for future cooperation, especially on peacekeeping   operations.

Qasim al-Araji traveled to Tehran at the head of a security delegation on Sunday under the direction of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. According to the report, the Iraqi delegation will meet with Iranian authorities to complete the implementation of the recent security agreement. Anti-Iran terrorists occasionally attempt to use the Kurdistan region to target Iranian soil or to smuggle weapons into the country and target Iran's security. The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has now and then targeted terrorists' lairs in the Kurdistan region. Iran has repeatedly urged Baghdad and Erbil to meet their commitments toward Iran and take necessary measures to make the common border between the countries secure. Last month, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said his country is committed to a security pact with Iran to disarm anti-Iran terrorist groups based in the Kurdistan region. He made the remarks at a joint press conference with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in Tehran on September 13. Hussein said the terrorist groups will be transferred to camps supervised by the United Nations. He made clear that the Iraqi constitution does not allow any group to use Iraqi territory to attack other countries, saying the security agreement between the two neighboring countries is also based on the Arab country's constitution. He also said the Baghdad government and the Kurdistan region are cooperating with each other in this regard and both stress the necessity of implementing the security agreement. Amir-Abdollahian, for his part, underscored that the Islamic Republic of Iran is serious when it comes to providing the country's national security. ""Efforts are underway to disarm them and fully implement the clauses of the security agreement between the two countries,"" he added. Two days before the two foreign ministers visited, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kan'ani also said the ultimatum given to Iraq to disarm anti-Iran separatist groups based in the Kurdistan region would not be extended.

Islam, 45, a longtime Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation labor organizer, was beaten to death in Gazipur, a major garment industry hub on the outskirts of Dhaka. At the time, he was trying to intervene on behalf of workers in a factory dispute over unpaid wages. Colleagues allege he was killed by factory-hired goons. ""The motive was to prevent him from speaking on behalf of workers so that the factory management could get rid of him and not pay the workers,"" union president Kalpona Akter told VOA. Akter filed a police complaint. The Industrial Police Unit is currently investigating the case and has made a few arrests but has yet to file any charges. An officer who is investigating the incident would not comment when contacted by VOA in early September, saying the case was still ""being investigated."" Akter said Islam was a target of threats and assaults by factory owners and law enforcement authorities in the past because of his labor rights work. The Bangladesh government has a history of cracking down on trade union activists in the garment industry, and putting them behind bars, a move that has been criticized by human rights groups. ""Bangladesh authorities should ensure that an independent and thorough investigation is conducted to hold accountable all those involved in directing, planning, and executing the attack,"" Human Rights Watch said in a September 14 statement. Activists from Clean Clothes Campaign, a Netherlands-based workers' rights organization, protested in Amsterdam last month at a Bangladesh garment industry exhibition to urge the Bangladeshi government, the employers' association, and brands sourcing from Bangladesh to take immediate action regarding Islam's killing. Activists also demanded safeguards for the right to organize, and a new minimum wage in line with workers' demands in Bangladesh. Difficulties organizing Labor activists say Bangladeshi factory owners block workers from forming unions, despite laws that in theory allow workers to organize. Bangladeshi law requires at least 20% of a factory's workforce in a factory to sign a petition if they want to form a union. However, union organizer Dolly Akhtar in Gazipur, told VOA that once signature collection starts, ""the factory management finds out pretty soon, and they try everything in their power to foil the attempt to form a union in their factory."" Factory owners commonly threaten workers and organizers with dismissal and blacklisting if they attempt to unionize, Akhtar said. ""I've received countless written and verbal threats for trying to organize workers and demand due payments, severances and better working conditions,"" she said. ""The factory authorities often use the thugs and goons, local political leaders to intimidate me. They have money and the means to make anyone dance to their tune. They filed bogus cases against me, and local goons stopped me on the road to threaten me at night when I come back home. Because I am a woman they think I'll get scared easily,"" Akhtar said. Additionally, government bureaucracy and red tape remain significant obstacles to union formation. The law requires a lengthy and complex registration process, which can drag on for months or years. As a result, only a small percentage of garment workers in Bangladesh, about 7%, are union members, according to a 2020 Cornell University report. Workers' rights groups have been advocating reforms to give workers more power and protect union organizers for a long time. ""It's crucial to prioritize the safety of these dedicated organizers because they are the backbone of the labor movement. Their safety ensures the continued empowerment of workers and the protection of their rights. Without secure and protected organizers, the struggle for fair labor practices and workers' rights would be significantly hampered,"" said Sarwer Hossain, a grassroots union organizer in Savar of Bangladesh Textile and Garment Workers League. Christie Miedema of Clean Clothes Campaign called on international brands to ensure that the factories they use follow ethical labor standards.

Speaking to Tasnim news agency on Sunday, Irani said that the missile-equipped destroyer will be unveiled soon. Sabalan is an Alvand-class frigate of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy. It was damaged in an encounter with the US Navy in the Persian Gulf during the 1980s Iraqi-imposed war. After a few years, the 1,500-ton destroyer was repaired by domestic experts. Previously, Sablan was furnished with 4 anti-ship cruise missiles and took part in 13 Iranian naval fleets. Iran's Sahand and Sina frigates have each been equipped with eight cruise missiles. Iran's Navy has in recent years achieved self-sufficiency in manufacturing equipment. It has also increased its presence in international waters to protect naval routes and provide security for merchant vessels and tankers. On Saturday, during a ceremony in commemoration of the anniversary of the Iraq-imposed war, Irani said the navy will also take delivery of a new domestically designed and developed destroyer in the near future, which is furnished with much more advanced and elaborate systems compared to the military vessels already unveiled. He said that the homegrown military vessel, dubbed Deylaman, will soon join Iran's naval fleet. Irani also said that the Iranian Navy plans to set up a base in Antarctica. Iran's southeastern Makran coast is directly connected to the South Pole and the deployment of Iranian servicemen in that region would be of a practical nature, he added, saying, Antarctica is the best place to control the cruise of ballistic missiles.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian's office told journalists early on September 30 that authorities had registered 81,827 of the 100,437 people who had left Nagorno-Karabakh so far -- the latter representing more than three-quarters of the higher estimates of the territory's entire population. The update came hours after Armenia said it had filed a suit with the UN International Court of Justice (ICJ) to prevent the targeting of ethnic Armenians amid signs of a roundup by Baku amid the massive exodus a week after Azerbaijan seized Nagorno-Karabakh in a lightning offensive. Armenian officials and outsiders have expressed fears of ethnic cleansing and international calls have escalated for help to avoid a humanitarian disaster. Azerbaijan, meanwhile, has urged ethnic Armenians to stay and has invited UN agencies to send a mission ""to become acquainted with the current humanitarian activities being carried out by Azerbaijan in the region."" The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said on September 30 that its forces were taking ""retaliatory measures"" after one of its soldiers was killed by an Armenian Army sniper on the border between the two countries. Armenia denied the accusation, saying the claim ""does not correspond to reality."" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said late on September 29 that the United Nations will send a mission this weekend to Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory but was controlled by ethnic Armenians with Yerevan's support for decades since the waning years of the Soviet Union. Dujarric said the UN mission will mainly assess humanitarian needs in a region to which it had not had access ""in about 30 years."" ""The government of Azerbaijan and the UN have agreed on a mission to the region. The mission will take place over the weekend,"" Dujarric told reporters. Both sides have expressed hope that a more durable peace agreement between the longtime Caucasus archfoes might be reached ahead of a possible meeting between Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian in connection with European-wide meetings in Granada, Spain next week. But Azerbaijani authorities have detained several key figures from the ethnic Armenian leadership of Nagorno-Karabakh, which Armenians refer to as Artsakh. The Artsakh leadership has already announced that it would cease to exercise authority over the territory by the end of this year, a bitter pill for Armenians who have made control of Nagorno-Karabakh a national priority. European and other Western governments meanwhile have been responding to Armenia's calls for assistance to help it deal with the influx of refugees. The office of Italy's prime minister said in a statement that Armenia has asked the EU for temporary shelters and medical supplies, adding that Rome is working to promote stabilization in the region. European Commission spokesman Peter Stano said ""urgent, continuous, unhindered humanitarian support"" is needed to support the people who are still in Nagorno-Karabakh as well as those who have left. The EU supports the work of the Red Cross, he said, saying that the European Commission announced an additional 5 million euros in humanitarian aid to help those displaced from Nagorno-Karabakh and those in vulnerable situations in the region. He also said it is important that the UN mission be able to enter the area in the next few days.

Azerbaijani media reported on Sunday the mission was led by a senior aid official and was the first of its kind sent to the region in nearly three decades. The arrival came as an estimate released by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Sunday suggested that more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians had fled Nagorno-Karabakh to neighboring Armenia in recent days. It also came after the World Court, formally known as the International Court of Justice, ordered Azerbaijan in February to ensure free movement through the so-called Lachin corridor which connects Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia. Armenian authorities have called for a tougher World Court order that would force Azerbaijan to give the UN access to civilian establishments in Nagorno-Karabakh and lead to a full withdrawal of Azerbaijani forces from the region. Areas surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh was liberated by Azerbaijan in a 2020 war with pro-Armenian forces. The regional director of the WHO's Regional Office for Europe said in a statement on Sunday the body will continue to send experts to Armenia to help people fleeing the conflict. ""The challenges are truly enormous, and we're there to do all we can,"" said Hans Henri P Kluge. At least 170 people were killed this week amid the exodus after an explosion hit a fuel depot just outside the Karabakh capital, known as Stepanakert by Armenia and Khankendi by Azerbaijan. The Armenian government told Russia's RIA news agency late on Sunday the operation to relocate people willing to leave Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia was coming to an end.  ",en

Allowed to fester, it not only damages the perception of a mission and creates confusion about the role of 'blue helmets', it can also put their lives in jeopardy. Bintou Keita, the UN Special Representative for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and head of the UN mission there (MONUSCO), underscores that armed groups deliberately propagate falsehoods to incite discontent against the mission. They do so because they have a vested interest in preventing MONUSCO from being a witness to their actions, she told UN News in an in-depth interview shortly after briefing the UN Security Council, which oversees all peacekeeping missions worldwide. She described how MONUSCO is combating misinformation and disinformation in the field, and engaging with young people to empower them to prevent the spread of false information. She updated ambassadors on the situation in the country, in light of President Félix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo's call at the UN General Debate last week, for the mission to expedite its planned withdrawal.  The interview has been edited for clarity and length. UN News:At the recent general debate, the President of DRC said that it was imperative to accelerate the withdrawal of MONUSCO. Do you agree with him that the current situation requires an acceleration of a withdrawal? Bintou Keita:Just to frame the conversation, the notion of acceleration is important, but what is also important is the fact that the Mission, MONUSCO, has already been moving out of numerous provinces in DRC. For example, we have withdrawn from the Kasai province in June 2021. We also withdrew from the Tanganyika province in June 2022. And for the size of the country, where there are 26 provinces, MONUSCO is now deployed in only three provinces, Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu, and these are the three provinces where there are active conflicts with armed groups - both local armed groups and also foreign ones. So, the acceleration of our departure or withdrawal from the DRC will be from these three provinces, and it is going to happen in conversation and dialogue with the national authorities and the provincial authorities, in order to decide, based on the hotspots where the Mission is providing protection to the population. And there are not enough army or not enough police to make sure that they are going to be present. At the moment we are withdrawing and they are going to be in charge and take over the task of protecting the population. That is going to happen pretty soon because we have an understanding that it is a joint endeavor, one is going up the national authorities; and one is going out, which is MONUSCO. In DRC, the 26 provinces have 145 territories [administrative sub-division], of those 26 provinces and we are in three. The hotspots that we are looking at in the three provinces, when we talk about territories, it is more or less 15 to 20 territories where we have really to nail down the issue of physical protection of the population, because we also do protection through other means, which is advocacy that is the civilian component of the Mission to work with the provincial as well as the national authorities. UN News:Demonstrations have been organized against MONUSCO. Do you think that the role of peacekeepers is misunderstood and that misinformation plays a part in the perception of the Mission's role? Bintou Keita:I think yes, because there is a disconnect between the population's expectations regarding the implementation of the mandate and particularly the one which has to do with the Force, because this is a part that is the physical protection of the population. The population is of the view that if any person loses his or her life or in the presence of the MONUSCO Force, it means that MONUSCO is not doing its job properly. This is of course a huge disconnect, because the reality is that physical protection is the proximity and the presence, and it is also disarming in a number of ways the armed groups to come closer to the population. The disinformation is part of the expressions of anger and frustration from the population but it is also manipulation from a number of organizations because they have an interest to tarnish the legitimacy of the presence of MONUSCO as well as that they are interested in not having the Mission as a witness to some of the things that they are doing in the three provinces. UN News:Do you have a specific example of actions taken by MONUSCO to fight disinformation? Bintou Keita:Yes, since last year we have increased the way we are tackling disinformation. One of such activities is through workshops with young people where our colleagues in communication are training the young people to understand the difference between fake news, disinformation and misinformation. We are training them to decide, to make a pause, a stop and ask - ""Can I share this? Yes or no"". And when I see the reaction of the young people it looks like it is holding, they become more aware of the social media - which in a way is where everything goes, including lies and fabricated fake news. Just to give you one example, while the high level segment of the General Assembly was going on, I was in Kinshasa when somebody decided to create fake news which was a photo of me from I think three years ago, when I was the Assistant Secretary-General for Africa [at the UNHQs], in New York and had the text which was saying basically that I, as the head of MONUSCO, was resisting the departure of the Mission. This is untrue because, first of all, I was not here at the at the General Assembly. I was in Kinshasa. We had a discussion on what do we do, do we do we say that this is fake? What do we do at the end? I think the colleagues decided, OK, it is fake and it went. One of the things that matters most is the monitoring of social media, and MONUSCO colleagues now have fortnightly reports each month to see the trends and the discussions related to MONUSCO and with the support of colleagues here in at UNHQs in New York, they are really helping us in shaping in a certain way, the narrative about what the Mission is doing and what the Mission is not about. UN News:My last question is about the elections. The elections are planned for the end of this year. What kind of support MONUSCO provides to the authorities to organize these elections? Bintou Keita:We have different roles: One of the roles is to provide logistic support to the Electoral Commission, specifically, in the three provinces where we are deployed - in Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu - which we are doing. Second is to the advocacy to ensure that the parameters and the principles to ensure the quality of elections, which has to do with the transparency and credibility of the election, the peacefulness of the conduct and inclusivity. If we see acts, words or interventions that are not in line with those principles, we will be talking to all the stakeholders, wherever and whoever they are. And we do this not just alone, we do this with partners, the diplomatic community in the DRC and also civil society organizations, so that it is a joint and collective effort. We are also planning, alongside the Ministry of Interior, for election security. The way we are doing this is to have our expert embedded within a technical working group under the Ministry's stewardship. We also have a lot going on with regard to inclusion in the election, particularly in the implementation of Security Council 1325, where for us the representation of women, the participation of women, is absolutely key, be it as voter or as a candidate for the provincial or national elections for the parliament, but also as presidential candidates. So, we are doing a lot of training for women candidates to be assertive, to go into subjects where normally people do not expect them to go.  ",en

Most recently, the Guatemalan Public Ministry seized electoral materials under the custody of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE). This act followed earlier attempts to strip immunity of the TSE electoral officials along with raiding their offices and storage facilities that house elections results. Such anti-democratic behavior undermines Guatemala's democratic institutions and is inconsistent with the principles of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. The United States stands with those seeking to safeguard democracy and rule of law in Guatemala. We are actively taking steps to impose visa restrictions on individuals who continue to undermine Guatemala's democracy, including current and former members of Congress, judicial actors, and any others engaging in such behavior. These individuals will be ineligible for entry into the United States under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which restricts visas for individuals believed to be responsible for, complicit in, or undermining democracy. The United States also supports the ongoing work of the OAS Special Mission to assist with the presidential transition, as called for by the OAS Permanent Council. The Guatemalan people have spoken.

The deployment will provide an opportunity for RAF pilots to practice dogfighting against different types of aircraft, and develop tactics to exploit their weaknesses. The Typhoons, which deployed to Poland today, will remain in Poland for two weeks and practice engaging targets beyond visual range, simulating various possible combat scenarios. They will be supported by a team of more than 50 RAF personnel during the deployment. It is just one of many joint exercises conducted with Polish forces, including the UK's permanent deployment of hundreds of troops in Poland as part of our NATO commitment under Operation CABRIT. The activity comes ahead of UK Ministers attending the Warsaw Security Forum this week. Defence Minister James Heappey and FCDO ministers Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Lord Ahmad will all use the forum to stress the need to maintain support for Ukraine and keep up the pressure on Russia. Earlier this year, the UK and Polish foreign secretaries and defence ministers signed a strategic partnership on foreign policy, security and defence - emphasising both countries' commitment to European security and collective defence through NATO. On Wednesday, James Heappey will visit RAF personnel deployed with the Typhoons, as well as troops deployed in eastern Poland who operate the Sky Sabre surface-to-air missile system, bolstering Poland's air defences close to the border with Ukraine. The Warsaw Security Forum is focused on transatlantic cooperation in response to common challenges, first organised in 2014, bringing together ministers and senior officials from across defence to provide a forum to discuss challenges facing Central and Eastern Europe, and the wider international community. The UK is the Partner Nation of this year's Warsaw Security forum and the British Embassy Warsaw has worked closely with the Polish government and conference organisers to design a programme that reflected the UK's objectives and views, as outlined in the Integrated Review Refresh 2023 and the Defence Command Paper 2023.

Using AI at work can actually hurt your job performance — if it's used for tasks outside of its capabilities,new research from Boston Consulting Group found. A group of researchers from BCG, Harvard, Wharton, and MIT conducted an experiment to see how access to AI impacts white-collar workers' productivity and quality of work. To test this, researchers randomly assigned 758 consultants at BCG across one of three groups: one with no access to AI; one with access toChatGPT powered by GPT-4; and one with access to ChatGPT, as well as instructional videos and documents on prompt engineering strategies. After establishing performance baselines, consultants in each group were assigned one of two categories of tasks. One category included 18 tasks that exist ""inside the frontier"" of what the AI can do, like brainstorming innovative beverage concepts or coming up with a thorough business plan for a new footwear concept. The other category contained more open-ended tasks that exist ""outside the frontier"" of AI's capabilities. While ""consultants would excel"" at these tasks, ""AI would struggle without extensive guidance,"" the study said. For example, consultants assigned this set of tasks were asked to offer recommendations to the CEO of a hypothetical company by using internal financial data and interviews with company insiders — information the AI didn't have access to. Researchers found stark differences in the results of the three groups, depending on their access to ChatGPT. For tasks ""inside the frontier,"" consultants using AI were ""significantly more productive"" and ""produced significantly higher quality results"" than those who weren't using the chatbot. However, consultants using AI to complete tasks ""outside the frontier"" were ""19 percentage points less likely to produce correct solutions compared to those without AI."" That's because the consultants with AI were found to indiscriminately listen to its output — even if the answers were wrong. These findings demonstrate AI's ""uneven"" capabilities. While the study's findings show that AI is ""exceedingly good"" at helping humans with some tasks, humans should exercise caution when using the technology to avoid errors, Saren Rajendran, one of the researchers involved in the study, told Insider in an email. ""We should be mindful when using GenAI,"" he added. BCG's findings demonstrate a cautionary tale for workers thinking about using ChatGPT to help do their jobs. Since ChatGPT came out last November, workers across industries have beenusing the AI chatbot—sometimes without telling their bosses— todevelop code,create marketing materials, andgenerate lesson plans. However, ChatGPT's outputs aren't perfect and can contain ""hallucinations."" Tech publicationCNET was put on blast earlier this year after readers noticed that a number of itsAI-generated articles included factual errors. As of September 28, media watchdogNewsGuardhas identified 487 ""unreliable"" AI-generated news sites with ""little to no human oversight."" In an ad for Google's Bard,the AI chatbot made a factual errorwhen asked about the James Webb Space Telescope. AI-generated errors may only get worse: In a recent paper, AI researchers found thatgenerative AI models could soon be trained on AI-generated content— a phenomenon they call ""model collapse."" The result could be more low-quality outputs in the near future. ""As the boundaries of AI capabilities continue to expand, often exponentially, it becomes incumbent upon human professionals to recalibrate their understanding of the frontier and for organizations to prepare for a new world of work combining humans and AI,"" the researchers wrote.",en

Though he hasn't given a reason, it might be because the White House has been the epicenter of revolutions and riots in Kyrgyzstan since the country gained independence 30 years ago and where the first popular upheaval sent unwanted President Askar Akaev fleeing to Moscow in 2005. So Japarov was certainly happy to announce that a spanking new presidential building would be constructed for him and his administration along the gorgeous mountains that partially flank Bishkek.

The 54-year-old president said Kyrgyzstan's new White House would be erected on the former site of the Issyk-Kul Hotel, which was being demolished after being abandoned for many years. The building will be approximately 30,000 square meters and serve as the headquarters for the presidential administration and the cabinet of ministers. Most importantly, Japarov added that ""we will only exchange 16 hectares of state land from the Presidential Property Management Department [to the builders] and they will build us a building [in return]. That is all. State land has been plundered [by officials] for 30 years [and] these 16 hectares would have also gone into private hands one day. Instead [of letting that happen], we decided to [use the land as payment in exchange for the] construction of a building for the country."" But that might not be ""all."" In an investigation conducted by RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service, connections were uncovered between a top official in the government and the construction company that has now received the valuable plot of land in a coveted part of Bishkek. The ties suggest major conflicts of interest. And it was later revealed that, instead of gifting the company -- Inshaat Stroy Building (ISB) -- the 16 hectares of state land that Japarov originally cited, the Kyrgyz government instead gave it 25.7 hectares in exchange for a new presidential building. But no explanation was offered for the nearly 10 more hectares of extra land given to ISB. The total cost of the new presidential building has also not been made public. Ritzy Real Estate And the land that ISB received is not any ordinary plot of land. According to independent experts those 25.7 hectares -- located in the picturesque southern part of the capital -- are worth an estimated $77 million. Since that end of Bishkek is close to the mountains, it provides access to great views, nature, and fresh air -- as downtown Bishkek is one of the most-polluted cities in the world. So real estate in that area is expensive and much sought after by construction companies. ""A hundred square meters of land above the Tushtuk Magistral (the capital's Southern Highway) ranges from $25,000 to $35,000 in value. In this neighborhood, land is costly and its value will continue to increase yearly,"" Konstantin Pomykalov, director of Vash Expert Company, told RFE/RL. Parliament deputy Dastan Bekeshev has criticized the government's decision to allocate such a large tract of state property to a private company. He says the land should be provided for constructing schools, parks, and other public facilities. ""We are currently unaware of the amount of money from the budget spent on the ongoing construction and the dismantling of the Issyk-Kul Hotel. It is best for us that we remain unaware, as the information regarding the actual costs of constructing the White House is classified, otherwise you might have a heart attack,"" Bekeshev said. ""It has become evident that the comfort of state officials and the profit of a private company take precedence over the public interest."" Since the total construction cost of the new presidential offices has not been made public, it is unclear if the some $77 million worth of land that ISB was given exceeds the costs of the new White House. Link To The Company Getting The Lavish Land? ISB was established in 2020 and has undergone nine reregistrations since then, resulting in changes to its name, its founders, and its managers. The most recent alteration occurred on July 28, just days before the company acquired the pricey state property. Notably, three of its past managers have connections to Kanybek Tumanbaev, the head of Japarov's presidential administration. RFE/RL sent a letter to Tumanbaev on August 23 asking about his links to the construction company. No response had been received at the time of publication. On September 17, Tumanbaev conducted a live stream on his Facebook page and commented on the construction works of the new presidential offices. ""In Kazakhstan, Aqorda, [the presidential palace], was built for $652 million, and ours is being built for one-tenth of the cost. It will not be like previously [in Kyrgyzstan] where someone's company or someone's interest [will be involved],"" he claimed. ""There was criticism earlier about [the houses being built in] Batken and [the Russian news agency] Sputnik was investigating the case. Dear friends, every penny of the state is under the control of our president and [the head of the Kyrgyz National Security Committee Kamchybek Tashiev],"" Tumanbaev pledged. Tumanbaev was previously named in an investigation by the independent media outlets Temirov LIVE and MediaHub regarding corruption within Kyrgyz Railways and affairs involving the country's Muftiate -- the state's Spiritual Administration of Muslims. Another scandal emerged -- as Tumanbaev mentioned -- following an investigation on construction work after last year's Kyrgyz-Tajik border clashes, when many houses and some villages were destroyed and needed to be rebuilt. The investigation alleged that the Amanat Stroy Invest company, the main contractor that won government tenders, was involved in corruption in the building of homes and public facilities in the Batken region. The investigation said that Tumanbaev had links to Amanat Stroy Invest. Tumanbaev denied any connection to the company and, soon after the investigation, Japarov praised Tumanbaev as a high performer who had supervised the construction work ""perfectly"" and ""saved every 'tyiyn' (penny) of state money."" Japarov did not address the alleged ties between Tumanbaev and the construction company. Friends And Partners First established as Express-Stroy KG, ISB was acquired in 2021 by Nurdin Ravshanbekovich Sabirov and Erlan Syrgabekov. Six months later it came under the ownership of Akhmadshokh Ravshanbekovich Azatov and Ermek Atantaev. Sabirov and Azatov are the sons of Ravshanbek Sabirov, the former director of the National Investment Agency under Japarov. Interestingly, Ravshanbek Sabirov, Tumanbaev, and former Grand Mufti Maksatbek Toktomushev are business partners. In 2019, they attended the opening ceremony of the Black Star Burger restaurant in Bishkek. Star Russian rapper Timati was the guest of honor and was greeted by Tumanbaev. At that time, the Black Star Burger franchise was owned by Arzygul Sabirova and Baatyrbek Jantaev -- who is a relative of Tumanbaev. Media reports said Sabirova is Ravshanbek Sabirov's wife and Jantaev is a known business confidant of Tumanbaev. Ravshanbek Sabirov denies that Sabirova is his wife. The web of connections continues. In 2021, Atantaev was the director and owner of the construction company BKS. Prior to him, from 2016 to 2019, Tumanbaev owned the same company, as found in data on osoo.kg. During the 2020 parliamentary elections, Tumanbaev ran as a member of the Birimdik (Unity) party and initially indicated himself as the director of BKS. However, he later transferred the management to Jantaev. In 2020-21, both Tumanbaev and Kyrgyz Grand Mufti Maksatbek Toktomushev owned the company RIBH, with Atantaev serving as the acting director. The Chauffeur's Chauffeur? Tumanbaev has long been a dodgy figure in Kyrgyz politics. He began his ascent during Almazbek Atambaev's tenure as president from 2012 to 2017, when he served as a driver for Ikramjan Ilmiyanov -- who went from being Atambaev's driver to being deputy head of the presidential administration and a power broker under Atambaev. That initial job has led to Tumanbaev being known colloquially as ""the driver's driver."" Nobody Home At ISB 'Offices' The legal location of ISB has also raised eyebrows. The official address of the company leads to a modest residence on Arashan Street in Bishkek's Bakai-Ata neighborhood. When RFE/RL went to the home, the family members living in the house said they had no connection to the construction company. A resident who identified herself as Zainura -- the daughter of the house's owner -- expressed surprise when questioned about her family's involvement in the construction of the new White House. She said the residents of the home have been actively trading goods at a local bazaar for many years and had not heard of the ISB or taken part in any of its activities. Zainura told RFE/RL on a phone call later that she has lived in the house for more than 30 years and was unaware of any connection to ISB. ""I've lived here since the Bakai-Ata neighborhood was established. We have no relatives or acquaintances involved in the construction [of the White House]. Recently, someone else also came here looking for [ISB]. I don't know why our address was indicated [as the company's legal address],"" she said. It is unclear why the ISB company is registered at the address of an ordinary citizen's home. The alleged connections between the official overseeing construction of the presidential building and former managers of the company that received the land raises questions, such as on what grounds was ISB chosen as a constructor? There is a law in Kyrgyzstan known as On Conflict Of Interest in which ""personal interests may affect the performance of official duties, which leads or may lead to a violation of the rights and interests of citizens, organizations, or the state."" Written by Baktygul Chynybaeva in Prague based on reporting by Aibek Biybosunov in Bishkek.

At 10 am on September 30, Xi and other leaders of the CPC â€¬and the state sang the national anthem together with other participants and then paid a silent tribute to heroes who devoted their lives to the liberation of the Chinese people and the construction of the People's Republic of China.â€¬ People from all walks of life - veterans, retired senior officials and the relatives of martyrs - as well as Chinese Young Pioneers offered flower baskets and bouquets in tribute to the martyrs. In front of the Monument to the People's Heroes, the giant flower basket with the words ""Bless the Motherland"" was erected, as the 74th National Day is approaching. Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, encouraged the children of martyrs to follow the examples of their heroic parents' generation and dedicate themselves to serving as the loyal guardians of the Party and the people in a letter replying to eight such children who are currently studying at the People's Public Security University of China on September 28, the Xinhua News Agency reported. In the letter, which was issued ahead of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day, Xi expressed his hopes for the students and extended his greetings to the family of the martyrs from the public security system. Safeguarding national security and social stability as well as the people's happiness and tranquility is the sacred duty of the people's police, he said. Encouraging students to follow the examples of their parents' generation, Xi asked them to maintain firm ideals and convictions, work hard in their study and training, hone their skills, and dedicate themselves to serving as the loyal guardians of the Party and the people. Xi also encouraged them to make unremitting efforts to build a peaceful China at a higher level, and actively contribute to the great cause of building a strong country and achieving national rejuvenation. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, more than 17,000 police officers have died in the line of duty, with more than 3,700 of them being honored as martyrs. China's top legislature approved September 30 as Martyrs' Day in 2014 to commemorate those who sacrificed their lives for national independence and prosperity. People in many cities across China held various memorial activities to commemorate the martyrs, with many people spontaneously visiting war memorial museums to lay bouquets and pay their tribute. Over the past week, soldiers, representatives from all walks of life, primary and secondary school students descended on major memorials across the country to pay their respects to heroes. Multiple theater commands and armed police organized officers and soldiers to participate in memorial activities at the martyrs memorial parks, inspiring them to become heroes of the new era. On September 25, in the hinterland of Karakoram Plateau located in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, after a new snowfall, the Martyrs' Cemetery at an altitude of 4280 meters in Kangxiwa appeared even more solemn and sacred. The officers and soldiers of a border defense regiment stationed in the western frontier of Xinjiang came here to pay tribute to the martyrs. Before September 30, martyr memorial facilities in Sichuan's Suining, Guang'an, Panzhihua, Aba, and other places completed a full upgrade and were open to the public. The Binjiang Village Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery is the only martyr cemetery that was funded and built by local villagers in Dandong, Northeast China's Liaoning Province. Among the 33 martyrs, only five of them left their names behind. Over 70 years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteer (CPV) Army gathered and trained near Binjiang village before going abroad for combat. During the war, dozens of wounded and sick volunteers who were transported back from the front lines and died due to their serious injuries were buried on the nearby hillside of Binjiang village. Memorial activities were held not only in China. In places where Chinese soldiers sacrificed for world peace are often accompanied by a cup of wine and a bouquet of white chrysanthemums such as in the Cemetery for Martyrs of the CPV in Anju, South Pyongan, in North Korea and the ""China Yadgar,"" the Chinese cemetery located in Danyor, Pakistan, where Chinese workers and engineers who laid their lives in the construction of Karakoram Highway.

Today we can already assess this week's key result for our defense   industry. A truly new stage of the Ukrainian defense industry's   development has begun. The first Defense Industries Forum took place. It was extremely   successful. And it testified to the global interest in the opportunity   to work in Ukraine and with Ukraine in the production of weapons and   everything necessary for the real defense of any free nation. Our new format with defense companies - the Defense Industries   Alliance - includes 38 member companies as of this evening. They   represent 19 countries. These are the United States, the United Kingdom,   Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Canada, Bulgaria, Australia,   Belgium, our Baltic friends - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, as well as   the Czech Republic, North Macedonia, Slovakia, Spain, Croatia and   Finland. This is a very powerful start, and the work is ongoing. More   companies will join. In addition, our manufacturers signed 20 documents with partner   companies at the Forum. Agreements and memoranda. Each such document   then becomes a new production or an enhancement of existing cooperation. These are agreements on joint production, exchange of technologies,   supply of components. Propellant powder production, munitions   manufacturing. This is the training of personnel for our defense   industry. Separately, and very thoroughly, we are developing the   Ukrainian manufacturing of drones, land and naval autonomous systems. All in all, more than 250 companies took part in our Defense   Industries Forum - and this forum is only the first one of its kind.   Dozens of Ukrainian companies were among them. We are also working to ensure that Ukraine produces the air defense systems we need - truly powerful ones. When we eventually see and feel the maximum arms power of Ukraine in   real action - of our manufacturers, our defense industry, our new   cooperation with the world - we will be able to say that the foundation   of this was laid right now, in the agreements like those reached at the   Forum and during my visits, in particular to the United States, Sweden   and other countries. All the most powerful countries are already   cooperating or will cooperate with Ukraine. Our country will become one of the world's key producers of weapons   and defense systems. And this is no longer just an ambition or a   prospect, it is a potential that is already being realized. I am   grateful to everyone whose work leads to such results for Ukraine! Currently, and we have to be honest about this, Ukraine is a   recipient of security assistance. But our country can and will become a   donor of global security. In particular, thanks to our defense industry.   Thanks to the strength, resilience, and indomitability of our people. Tomorrow is a very important day for Ukraine, for all our people. The   Day of Defenders of Ukraine. Of the millions who have not only   preserved Ukraine's decent place in human history, but also make sure   that our people and our state do not lose their history, fight for their   lives and freedom, and inspire the entire free world with their   struggle. Tomorrow, we will pay special tribute to all our defenders. Tomorrow   we will honor the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine. For the first time, this day - the Intercession of the Most Holy   Theotokos - will be on October 1. And let's establish a new tradition   for this day. October 1. 9:00 a.m. Wherever you are - on the main street of your   city or just at home - stop for a minute, honor with silence the memory   of our fallen defenders and think about those who are now in combat, on   combat missions, at their posts. Those who save lives. Those who protect   our people and state in every sense of the word. There would be no strength and will of Ukraine if it were not for all those who stood up for Ukraine. We are thankful. We honor. We remember. All together. Glory to Ukraine!  ",en

In a Sunday meeting with Armen Grigoryan, the secretary of the National Security Council of Armenia, in Tehran, Ahmadian pointed to the latest developments in the Caucasus region and urged all parties to help establish peace and security in the region. Nagorno-Karabakh is a landlocked region in the Caucasus and lies within Azerbaijan's borders. The region has always been internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan though it is mostly populated by ethnic Armenians, who have resisted Azerbaijan's sovereignty over the territory. Last week, Azerbaijan launched an operation designed to seize control of the breakaway territory and perhaps end a three-decade-old conflict. The operation ended on September 20, after the Azerbaijani military routed Armenian forces in 24 hours and made the separatists agree to lay down weapons, under a Russian-mediated ceasefire. Ahmadian reaffirmed Iran's principled and unchanging policy on developing cooperation and interaction with the neighboring states and creating a region free of conflict. ""Frank and constructive dialogue among regional countries will prepare the ground for [improving] sustainable security, balanced development and prosperity of the nations in the region,"" the SNSC secretary said. Ahmadian voiced Iran's readiness to arrange a meeting among the regional states. He placed a premium on increasing economic cooperation and joint commercial exchanges between Iran and Armenia and said Tehran is keen to boost relations with Yerevan in all sectors. Grigoryan, for his part, said Iran and Armenia enjoy deep-rooted relations and voiced Yerevan's readiness to enhance comprehensive relations with Tehran. The Armenian security chief hailed Iran's effective role in establishing peace and stability in the Caucasus region and called on Tehran to proceed with its efforts in this regard. He highlighted the significance of the economic, commercial and industrial projects between the two countries.  ",en

We strongly denounce the recent terrorist act as a wanton violation of international law and an undisguised infringement on the sovereignty of Cuba. Lurking behind the incident is the sinister intention of the anti-Cuban forces in the U.S. to tarnish the international image of Cuba, with the final aim of overthrowing the social system of socialist Cuba. Though the truth behind a shooting spree case against the Cuban embassy in the U.S. three years ago has not been probed yet, there took place again another case of throwing gasoline bottle bomb to threaten the lives of diplomats. This goes to prove that the above-said incidents were committed evidently at the tacit connivance of the U.S. administration. The U.S. is keen only on putting those countries incurring its displeasure on the list of sponsors of terrorism, purposely turning away from the obligations of the receiving state stipulated in the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. This can never be justified in any case. The U.S. arrogant and despicable anti-Cuban moves are facing the strong protest and denunciation by the international community aspiring after the respect for sovereignty of an independent and sovereign state and justice. If the U.S., always clamoring for ""observance of international law"" and boasting of ""law-governed state"", has the slightest will to defend its ""honor"", it should, though belatedly, acknowledge the blame for not only the recent incident but also all the past terrorist cases and probe their truth to show its sincerity. We have consistently and fully supported the just cause of the Cuban party, government and people for defending the sovereignty and socialism and will always stand together with the Cuban people in the struggle against all sorts of terrorism. -0-  ",en

Iran's special representative for Afghanistan, Hassan Kazemi-Qomi, made the remarks at the Moscow Format meeting on Afghanistan which was held in the Russian city of Kazan on Friday. He went on to say that the participants agreed significantly on preventing the US from re-entering Afghanistan and holding it accountable for the damages it inflicted upon the country during 20 years of occupation. Kazemi-Qomi further urged the neighboring countries of Afghanistan to enhance cooperation in order to help the country resolve its issues without relying on outside powers. He also noted that the 20-year-long occupation of Afghanistan by the US and its allies and the creation of ""a foreigners' front"" are not in line with Afghanistan's national interests, stressing the need for regional initiatives and the formation of Afghanistan's ""neighbors front"". The Iranian diplomat further praised the current caretaker government in Afghanistan in dealing with the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group and trying to improve the economic situation of the country. He also expressed hope that the country's caretaker government pursue the plan for implementing the neighborly policy through consultations with the neighboring nations and based on protecting Afghanistan's interests, stating that the economic and industrial development of Afghanistan requires the ""empathy and cooperation"" of the country's neighbors in a safe environment with guarantees. Friday's meeting was the fifth of its kind held by Russia to assess the situation in Afghanistan, with Taliban's Caretaker Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, President Rustam Minnikhanov, as well as representatives from the Russian Federation, China, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and India in attendance. Participants discussed a range of issues including reconciliation among Afghanistan's various parties, the country's reconstruction after the US-led war, fighting terrorism and guarantees for regional security, among other topics. The United States and its allies deployed troops to Afghanistan in 2001, saying at the time the objective was to fight al-Qaeda as part of Washington's so-called ""war on terror."" The pretext had taken shape in the 9/11 attacks. In August 2021, the Taliban recaptured several provincial capitals and seized Kabul with little-to-no resistance. The unexpected fall of the capital forced the US to carry out a hasty evacuation of diplomats, nationals, and Afghan helpers. Washington received severe criticism for its poor handling of the evacuation. After its withdrawal, Washington imposed sanctions on Afghanistan and blocked its assets. Foreign aid has declined dramatically since then and the country's key central bank assets have been seized by the United States, compounding one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.  ",en

The participants once again called on the Afghan authorities to create a truly inclusive system of government reflecting the interests of all key ethno-political groups in the country and also to step up counter-terrorism and anti-drug efforts.

Addressing students at Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran during a Saturday ceremony in commemoration of the anniversary of the 1980-88 Iraq-imposed war, Irani highlighted that the homegrown military vessel, dubbed Deylaman, will soon join Iran's naval fleet. He described Deylaman as much more sophisticated than Dena destroyer. Dena is reportedly the fourth Jamaran-class destroyer manufactured by the Defense Ministry's naval industries. The Iranian destroyer is equipped with various defense and offense systems, designed to make long journeys in the oceans, and capable of detecting, tracking, and hitting various aerial, surface, and submarine targets. Dena is also capable of carrying helicopters on its deck. Elsewhere in his remarks on Saturday, Irani stated that the Iranian Navy plans to set up a base in the Antarctica. Iran's southeastern Makran coast is directly connected to the South Pole and the deployment of Iranian servicemen in that region would be of a practical nature, he said. Antarctica is important from several different aspects as it is the best place to control the cruise of ballistic missiles, the high-ranking Iranian commander said. Iran's Navy has in recent years achieved self-sufficiency in manufacturing surface and sub-surface vessels. It has also increased its presence in international waters to protect naval routes and provide security for merchant vessels and tankers.  ",en

A commentary by Zachary Abuza 2023.09.30 -- As Myanmar's economy continues to skid, with soaring inflation, a depreciating kyat, and flat revenue, junta leader Min Aung Hlaing seems to be looking for a few Chinese-backed marquee projects to kickstart growth, and ensure Beijing's long-term commitment to the State Administrative Council, as the regime is formally known. In August Min Aung Hlaing called for the completion of the Kyaukphyu special economic zone (SEZ) and container port, while engineering work is starting on the 810 km railway connecting Kyaukphyu with Muse, a city on the Myanmar-China border. The project in western Myanmar has evolved and absorbed different components since a 2011 memorandum of understanding for the Kunming-Kyaukphyu railway led eventually to a set of projects under China's ambitious $1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative. But as the BRI prepares to celebrate its tenth anniversary at a summit in Beijing in October, China, unhappy with the slow pace of CMEC implementation, looks unlikely to extend an invitation to Min Aung Hlaing, denying him the recognition that he covets. Chinese projects in Myanmar were facing trouble before Min Aung Hlaing overthrew the country's elected government on Feb. 1, 2021. Now they are beset by unrest, power shortages and transport woes. Kyaukphyu began as a small port for offshore and imported oil, as well as being the land terminus for the Shwe gas field. The 51-49 joint venture between China National Petroleum Company and the Ministry of Oil and Gas Enterprises constructed a pier and 12 tanks, which commenced operations in 2013. The US$2.5 billion 750 km oil pipeline and 770 km gas pipeline to Kunming became fully operational in 2017. That year, PetroChina opened up a refinery in Kunming that was able to handle 7% of China's total refining needs. These pipelines were China's strategic priority, but Beijing had other goals for linking landlocked southwestern China to the Indian Ocean. China saw the project as a way to address what then Chinese President Hu Jintao described in 2003 as the ""Malacca dilemma"" of vulnerability to a naval blockade of the Southeast Asian waterway which carries two-thirds of China's energy imports and trade flows. In 2018, the two sides established the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) to jumpstart the projects as part of the BRI, the signature project of Hu's successor Xi Jinping. Beijing also saw as supporting Myanmar's National Ceasefire Agreement signed by some ethnic armies in 2015 to end years of hostilities with the government. All existing Myanmar projects were folded into the CMEC, and still there was little movement. Two of the first MOUs were a feasibility study for the first phase of the railway project and an environmental and sustainability impact study of Kyaukphyu. Ambitious projections A December 2015 tender between the government of reformist military leader Thein Sein and a consortium of Chinese corporations led by the state controlled investment company, CITIC, established the Kyaukphyu SEZ and deepwater port. The $7.3 billion project was 85% owned by the Chinese consortium. The phased project included the 1,736 hectare Kyaukphyu SEZ followed by two deep water container ports on Maday and Ramree islands. At capacity, 270 and 237 hectares ports would be able to berth 10 ships at once and handle 4.9 million containers annually. There were wild promises by CITIC, including projections of adding $10 billion to GDP annually and the creation of 100,000 new jobs. But little happened. And there was already pushback from the elected National League of Democracy government led by Aung San Suu Kyi . Fearful of a scenario that played out when Sri Lanka became heavily indebted to China, in 2018, the Suu kyi administration renegotiated the agreement, lowering China's stake to 70% as well as decreasing the overall debt for the project. But the ethnic cleansing and violence in Rakhine state, the location of the port facility, kept everything at a standstill. Xi Jinping's January 2020 visit to Myanmar took advantage of Aung San Suu Kyi's diplomatic isolation following the forced expulsion of Rohingya Muslims in 2017 that led to UN genocide charges. More than 30 agreements were signed, many of which related to Kyaukphyu and its rail links. Days before the February 2021 coup, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Suu Kyi to push for the quick implementation of CMEC projects, including Kyaukphyu. Seven months after the military seized power, site work began on the 1,740 hectare site. But there were immediate protests from the 20,000 people who were being displaced and harbored mistrust over promised compensation. Unrest was also fueled by civil disobedience against the coup, and junta crackdowns and arrests of local officials and activists. Another impediment for the project is the regional shortage of electricity. In 2019, a Hong Kong based firm, VPower, which is partially owned by CITIC, won an emergency tender to provide electricity in Myanmar. By 2021, it had nine different power projects around the country, including three in Kyaukphyu. Yet, the firm shut down the 200mw Kyaukphyu II project in mid-2021, despite it being a 60-month contract. By 2022, VPower had shut down the Kyaukphyu I  plant. Both were dismantled. The firm cited a number of factors in the closing of the plants, including irregular supply of LNG, currency controls and other issues related to the post-coup investment climate. Left unsaid was the government's inability to pay for the amount of electricity that it contracted for and to pay the sum in U.S. dollars. That left only one power plant in Kyaukphyu, a 135mw gas-fired plant, a 2020 joint venture between VPower, CNTIC, and Myanmar's Supreme Group. It was still in operation in early 2023, though there are reports that it has recently closed. Underwriting the junta Without power, little is progressing. In March 2023, a Chinese company signed a MOU to provide 100 mw of wind energy in Kyaukphyu, along with 150mw and 110 mw wind farms in nearby townships. Construction is to be completed in 2025. An Environment and Social Impact Assessment is supposed to be completed in late-2023, but has received pushback from people being displaced and fishermen who have already been harmed by the oil and gas terminals and will now lose river access. The junta is certain to green light the project regardless of the findings, and construction on the SEZ and first port are supposed to begin in 2024. Connectivity to the port is even further behind. There has been very little progress on the 810-km Muse-Kyaukphyu railway, while China has only completed a portion of the railroad from Kunming to the border. In mid-2023, Chinese engineers began field work for the first segment, a 431-km stretch from Muse to Mandalay, expected to cost $8.9 billion. Apart from topography, there are  engineering hurdles, as well as a surge in fighting in northern Shan State, which has stalled the development of a free trade zone. Notwithstanding the troubles, China has stepped up its investments since the coup, now totaling 597 projects worth $21.9 billion, 23.5% of all investment now in Myanmar. China is clearly pressing for the project's commencement to mitigate their Malacca dilemma. In May 2023, its ambassador in Naypyitaw lobbied for the project, while Deng Xijun, China's special envoy to Myanmar, reiterated the call in each of his four visits, most recently in September. Deng called on the three ethnic armed groups that form the Northern Alliance members to stop their fighting along Myanmar's border with China and to pledge to protect Chinese investments. Min Aung Hlaing is hopeful that CMEC will enmesh China in Myanmar's economy, forcing Beijing to underwrite the junta for the duration, so he needs to show progress. And yet, his call for the expedited completion of the Kyaukphyu project sounds as delusional as the other economic policies in the 32 months since the military coup. The general is failing to accept that foreign investors have pulled out, and that there's neither electricity nor connectivity, let alone any ability by Myanmar to service the debt.

Nazeli Baghdasaryan, a spokeswoman for Armenia's prime minister, said Saturday that the number of refugees entering the country over the past week had reached 100,417, out of Nagorno-Karabakh's estimated population of 120,000. The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) also said that 100,000 people had fled the region. It said many of those fleeing ""are hungry, exhausted, and need immediate assistance."" ""At most a few hundred persons remain, most of whom are officials, emergency services employees, volunteers, some persons with special needs,"" Artak Beglaryan, a former separatist official, wrote on social media. Nagorno-Karabakh is a landlocked region in the Caucasus and lies within Azerbaijan's borders. The region has always been internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan though it is mostly populated by ethnic Armenians, who have resisted Azerbaijan's sovereignty over the territory. Last week, Azerbaijan launched an operation designed to seize control of the breakaway territory and perhaps end a three-decade-old conflict. The operation ended on September 20, after the Azerbaijani military routed Armenian forces in 24 hours and made the separatists agree to lay down weapons, under a Russian-mediated ceasefire. Azerbaijan's president Ilham Aliyev said at the time that his government ""began sending humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan's Karabakh region. Fuel, foodstuffs, medicines were sent."" Yerevan, however, accused Baku of conducting a campaign of ""ethnic cleansing"" to clear Nagorno-Karabakh of its Armenian population. Baku has denied the claim and has publicly called on the Armenian residents of the territory to stay and ""reintegrate"" into Azerbaijan. On Thursday, the separatist region's leader Samvel Shakhramanyan agreed to dissolve the government by the end of the year and become a full part of Azerbaijan. The decision marked the end of a 30-year struggle for independence from Baku. Shakhramanyan said in his decree that ""all state institutions and organizations under their departmental subordination by January 1, and the Republic of Nagorno Karabkah (Artsakh) ceases to exist."" Residents were instructed to ""familiarize themselves with the contusion of reintegration presented by the Republic of Azerbaijan,"" it added. Baku is now holding ""re-integration"" talks with separatist leaders.  ",en

Norway is going in the same direction as EU countries bordering Russia, and has clarified that the ban on the import of Russian-registered passenger cars with nine or fewer seats also includes temporary admission. Norway is also introducing some exceptions to these restrictions. These changes will come into effect on 2 October 2023 at 24:00. ""Norway stands together with allies and like-minded countries in response to the brutal war of aggression that Russia is waging against Ukraine. It is crucial that the sanctions are effective in order to prevent income that the Russian state needs to finance the war,"" says Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt. The EU Commission issued updated guidance on the temporary import of, among other things, Russian-registered vehicles on 8 and 12 September. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland have followed the EU Commission's guidance by no longer allowing Russian-registered cars to cross the border into the EU, with some exceptions. Norway is now implementing similar measures. The new clarification of the restrictions means, among other things, that Russian-registered passenger cars with nine or fewer seats can no longer be brought into Norway, even temporarily. However, this regulation does not apply to vehicles with ten or more seats. It is still possible to cross the border with, for example, minibuses and buses at the Storskog border station as it stands now. The clarification is related to the import of goods and does not change the conditions for entry that applies to individuals. Exceptions are made for vehicles owned by Norwegian citizens or EEA citizens with permanent residence in Russia or their family members, temporary entry of vehicles necessary for humanitarian reasons, as well as diplomatic vehicles and vehicles belonging to international organizations or a state's courier services.

The other is one of the most technically sound batters in the world with a wide range of strokes with excellent skills of playing pace. However, the duo go back a long way, which Rauf recently recalled when he bowled toVirat Kohlias a net bowler in Australia during India’s tour of Australia in 2018-19. After that, Rauf had made his debut in 2020. Speaking in ESPNcricinfo’s documentary The Incredible rise of Haris Rauf, the Pakistani bowler said: “When I was a net bowler for the Indian team and was bowling to Virat Kohli, I felt like he knew exactly where the ball was going to hit his bat. He was very focussed and that showed how sharp his concentration was.” “Even during practice sessions in the nets, it felt like I was playing a match against him, despite being a net bowler. His remarkable control and intensity made me realise why he has such a reputation in the game.” Earlier, Rauf had also spoken about Kohli’s knock of 82* and the epic sixes that the Indian batter had hit at the MCG and said, “The way he [Kohli] played in the World Cup, that is his class, we all know the types of shots he plays. And the way he hit those sixes, I don’t think any other player can hit a shot like that off my bowling. IfDinesh Karthikor Hardik Pandya would’ve hit those sixes, I would’ve been hurting but those came off Kohli’s bat and he is a different class altogether.”",en

According to the news release posted on Friday, the body is requiring content providers earning $10 million or more in annual revenue to provide information about their activities and complete a registration form by November 28. The regulatory plan is devised to ensure that the streaming services make“meaningful contributions to Canadian and Indigenous content,”the CRTC said. “We are developing a modern broadcasting framework that can adapt to changing circumstances. To do that, we need broad engagement and robust public records,”Vicky Eatrides, Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer, CRTC said as quoted by the website.Still, the move was widely criticized in Canada and beyond. Elon Musk, the X (formerly Twitter) CEO slammed the Trudeau government for trying to suppress free speech in the country.“Trudeau is trying to crush free speech in Canada. Shameful.”Musk said in an X post on Sunday.  Trudeau is trying to crush free speech in Canada. Shameful.https://t.co/oHFFvyBGxu The remarks come in response to a tweet by a journalist and columnist Glenn Greenwald, who re-posted the CRTC news release criticizing the“censorship.” “The Canadian government, armed with one of the world’s most repressive online censorship schemes, announces that all “online streaming services that offer podcasts”must formally register with the government to permit regulatory controls,”Greenwald lamented in his post.

The new rules arise from the Online Streaming Act, formerly known as Bill C-11, that took effect in April this year. The legislation has given new powers to Canada’s broadcasting regulator and includes the ability to impose financial penalties against people and businesses that violate certain provisions of the Broadcasting Act or its regulations. In August this year, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram among others, pulled news content from their platforms in Canada in retaliation to new legislation requiring internet giants to pay publishers for the news articles shared on their social media sites.

The Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) said in a report that Cypriot laws appear strong on paper but are undercut by institutional flaws including numerous anti-corruption bodies that lack coordination, resources and authority. According to GRECO, Cyprus needs a stronger system of accountability in government to prevent influence-peddling and to stymie the risk of politicians serving the interests of big business and the wealthy. Efforts to combat this relationship between government and private interests are “narrow in scope,” it said, adding that more transparency is needed regarding politicians' assets and that people need better access to information. The group lauds Cyprus for passing new laws last year establishing the Anti-Corruption Authority, which protects whistleblowers and regulates lobbying while devoting more resources to internal auditing units at public institutions. Even so, GRECO notes there’s no system in place to identify major corruption risks for people in top decision-making positions “in a strategic manner” or to have them undergo integrity background checks before their appointment. The Charter of Ethics that such appointees must sign and swear on isn’t enough to ensure that anyone who breaks their oath would face serious consequences, it said. Moreover, new lobbying legislation needs additional “targeted guidance” for political appointees on how they should conduct themselves with lobbyists and others, it added. Cypriots are more distrustful of government than many other Europeans. A European opinion survey last year found that 94% of Cypriots believe corruption is widespread in the country – nearly 30% higher than the European Union average. That distrust has been fed in recent years by a now-defunct citizenship-for-investment program that raised billions of euros by granting passports to wealthy investors pouring at least 2 million euros ($2.1 million) each into the Cypriot economy. That program met an ignominious end in 2020 when the government scrapped it amid suggestions that politicians, land developers and lawyers were in cahoots to bend the laws for ineligible applicants. Trust in the police is also lower in Cyprus than in most other EU member countries. GRECO said there’s no system to assess the integrity force members. It added that the vetting of officers, from their recruitment to throughout their careers, needs to be bolstered. The group also said decisions on how officers are promoted or transferred need to be more transparent, while more should be done to strengthen the representation of women in all police ranks. Speaking at an anti-corruption forum last week, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides acknowledged waning public trust in government and its institutions. He pledged a series of actions to help beat back that perception over his five-year tenure, including the creation of an internal auditing body for the executive branch, a coordination and support secretariat to oversee the work of individual ministries, and a binding code of ethics.",en

In their shadow, several yellow construction vehicles sit beside mounds of upturned soil and the skeleton of a half-built warehouse. On a May afternoon this year, a group of women in blue and pink uniforms hurried from one building to another over the din of traffic and construction. This factory complex in Sriperumbudur, an industrial town in Tamil Nadu state, is one of Apple’s most important iPhone assembly hubs outside of China. It is operated by Foxconn, a Taiwan-based electronics manufacturing company. Three times per day, the gates to this factory open to swallow buses ferrying thousands of workers—around three-quarters of them women. These workers spend eight hours per day, six days per week, on a humming assembly line, soldering components, turning screws, or operating machinery. The factory is one of the biggest iPhone plants in India, with some 17,000 employees who churn out 6 million iPhones every year. And it’s fast expanding. Most of the 232 million iPhones Apple sold in 2022 came from factories in China, with many of them originating from a single massive Foxconn facility in Zhengzhou. But shifting geopolitical tides have recently forced Apple to re-evaluate its exposure to China. First came the pandemic, when Beijing’s harsh lockdowns badly disrupted global supply chains. Now U.S. intelligence assessments, made public this year, say that Chinese President Xi Jinping hasinstructedhis military to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027, and President Biden has said the U.S. woulddefendTaiwan in that scenario. A hot war with China could have disastrous consequences, not only for the world, but also for Apple’s ability to manufacture many of the products behind its $2.7 trillion business. And so the company is hedging its bets on India, a country shielded from China behind the world’s highest mountain range, and home to a young population of 1.4 billion people. In September 2022, Apple announced the iPhone 14 would be assembled in India for the first time. (Until then, the Sriperumbudur factory handled only older models.) In April of this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook flew to India, where he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pledged to invest ever more deeply in the country, and personally opened two Apple Stores. Now, workers at the Sriperumbudur factory arereportedlyassembling the new iPhone 15, which went on sale in September. Powering Apple’s pivot to India is Foxconn. By 2024, Foxconnhopesto nearly quadruple its production at this South Indian factory to 20 million iPhones per year, and reportedly plans to hire tens of thousands more workers to make that possible. Satellite images provided to TIME by Planet Labs show rapid expansion at the complex, with three new factory buildings constructed over the past two years and newly broken ground on space large enough to accommodate at least three more. Apple could manufacture 25% of all iPhones in India by 2025, up from just 5% in 2022, according to a JPMorgan analysis. This shift toward India has winners and losers. Foxconn has ahistoryof low pay, harsh working conditions, and exacting targets in its Chinese factories. And as Foxconn rushed into India to meet Apple’s demand, it created comparable conditions there. In 2021, 159 factory workers were hospitalized with food poisoning,as a resultof eating unhygienic food at a subcontractor-provided hostel. That incident set off a wave of protests that, for several days, drewmedia attentionto the squalid living conditions faced by iPhone assembly workers. The hospitalizations were followed by a government inspection into the factory—which has not previously been reported—that described numerous safety risks and workers’-rights violations. That government inspection, carried out in December 2021, prompted Foxconn to spend $1.6 million on improving health and safety in the factory with oversight from Apple and the state government of Tamil Nadu, Foxconn said in a statement to TIME. This story is based on an unreleased government document reviewed by TIME, as well as interviews this spring with four current workers and eight community organizers in and around Foxconn’s Sriperumbudur factory. All workers spoke on condition of anonymity, out of fear that speaking to the media would invite retaliation. “What we do in this factory is not what we studied for,” one female worker told TIME. “But it has become a matter of survival for our families.” Apple declined TIME’s request for a reporter to be given a tour of the Sriperumbudur factory for this story, and refused two requests to make a senior executive available for an interview. Foxconn did not respond to similar requests. In a statement, an Apple spokesperson said that the issues at the Sriperumbudur factory were addressed after the food-poisoning incident, and added that regular Apple audits have found that the conditions in the factory are continually improving. Foxconn said the health and safety of its employees is “a top priority.” At 9 a.m. on Dec. 17, 2021, two days after the food-poisoning incident, a health and safety inspector from the Tamil Nadu state government turned up at the gates of the iPhone factory in Sriperumbudur. The inspection found that six workers whose job was to manually solder iPhone parts together “were not provided with protective equipment” including safety goggles, chemical-resistant gloves, or respirators, according to a letter sent by the government inspector to Foxconn, a copy of which was reviewed by TIME. In the areas of the factory where soldering was carried out, the inspection found, the ventilation system was not sufficient to prevent “the escape and spread of toxic fumes into the working environment.” That soldering process, the letter said, was “highly hazardous to the health of workers.” In another part of the factory, the inspector found that workers “were not provided with suitable goggles to protect their eyes from the excessive light and infrared radiation.” He identified 77 pieces of automated machinery that were missing crucial “interlock” mechanisms on their doors to prevent operation under dangerous conditions, and 262 instances of missing guards on pressing machinery. The lack of these protective mechanisms, the letter said, posed a risk of bodily injury. And six large industrial ovens used to attach tiny electrical components to iPhone circuit boards, the letter said, had not been “tested by a competent person” before factory workers were expected to use them. Read More:How India’s Record-Breaking Population Will Shape the World The inspection also found several apparent employment-law violations, according to the letter. At least 11 workers in the factory, it said, had been required to work excessively high hours for the past three months. At least 17 workers had been required to work on Sundays—usually their only weekly day off—without being given a replacement day of leave within three days. “All latrines and urinals in the factory were not maintained in clean and sanitary conditions at all times,” the letter said, and debris was present on the ground floor of the factory that presented a safety risk. The factory manager had failed to keep a register of workers in the factory or a register of their wages, the inspector claimed. And more than 4,500 of the 6,126 workers in the factory at the time of inspection were allegedly employed not by Foxconn, but by 11 different subcontractors that were not legally registered with the Tamil Nadu directorate of industrial safety and health. The letter suggests that the inspector found multiple violations of state law. The same findings would also likely constitute violations of Apple’s 127-page “supplier code of conduct” which—on paper—guarantees the people who build iPhones the right to dignified work in a safe environment. This code says that Apple suppliers must provide “safe working conditions” including by providing personal protective equipment, ensuring adequate ventilation, and maintaining proper safety mechanisms on machinery. Any overtime must be voluntary, the document says. Workers should receive at least one day off per seven days, it adds, and have access to clean toilet facilities. Apple does not prevent its contractors from using third-party labor agencies to supply workers, but says these agencies must be legally registered. “Any violations of this Code may jeopardize a supplier’s business relationship with Apple up to and including termination,” Apple’s supplier code of conduct states. The Tamil Nadu inspector’s letter to Foxconn warned that “suitable action” would be taken against it within seven days, unless the company could explain why it “should not be prosecuted for the irregularities found” during the inspection. TIME was not able to confirm what measures, if any, the Tamil Nadu state government took in the aftermath of the letter. The Tamil Nadu directorate of industrial safety and health, which carried out the inspection, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The day after the inspection, Foxconn closed the factory. Shortly after, Apple sent in a team of independent auditors. But in public statements at the time, neither company mentioned that a government inspector had described a litany of failings inside the massive factory complex. Instead, both Apple and Foxconn issuedstatementssaying that they were concerned by the hygiene failures at off-site hostels, and that they would quickly work to address the conditions there. The statements gave the impression that the main risk to workers’ health and safety came from hostels run by subcontractors—not from Foxconn’s very own factory floor. The factory remained closed for nearly a month, and a phased reopening began on Jan. 12, 2022. In their statements to TIME for this story, Apple and Foxconn acknowledged that an inspection took place at the factory but did not comment on specific findings. “We took measures and addressed every issue the government raised from its inspection,” a Foxconn spokesperson said in a statement to TIME, without specifying what those issues were. “The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for Foxconn.” An Apple spokesperson also declined to comment on specific findings. “The issues at Foxconn Sriperumbudur were investigated and addressed a year and a half ago and we placed the facility on probation,” the spokesperson said in a statement to TIME in May. “During this period Foxconn invested in significant improvements and through quarterly, and at times weekly audits, Apple and independent auditors have tracked meaningful upgrades to the facility with frequent visits and employee interviews.” Apple-run surveys found employee satisfaction at the factory to have increased by 27% between August and December 2022, the spokesperson said. Foxconn implemented some positive changes in the months after the inspection, protests, and factory closure, according to three workers who spoke with TIME. Foxconn removed a rule that workers had to live in subcontractor-provided hostels, and increased workers’ salaries by 5,000 rupees ($60) per month to cover the costs associated with renting accommodations independently. Both the food in the factory’s canteen and the working conditions on the factory floor have improved since the protests, the workers said, while acknowledging that significant problems remain. Since the factory shut down and reopened, four current workers told TIME in May, it is generally a safer place to work. The same workers, however, complained of high production targets, as well as a system of subcontracting that in effect creates a two-tier workplace where a comparatively small number of Foxconn employees enjoy greater benefits and job security than a legion of temporary workers, hired by third-party Indian subcontractors, who also work inside the factory. (Three of the current workers TIME spoke with were employed via subcontractors; one was a Foxconn employee.) While the workers TIME spoke to agreed that conditions in the factory had improved since the 2021 protests and subsequent inspection, they also said that many problems persist. One problem three workers mentioned was their wages: ranging from 82 to 101 rupees per hour for slightly different roles inside the factory, equivalent to between $0.99 and $1.22 per hour. While such wages aremore than doubleTamil Nadu’s minimum wage for electronics workers, and still better than the perils of unemployment or work in India’s vast informal sector, they give workers little opportunity to move up the economic ladder, especially since many of them have children and elderly parents to support. “In the Indian context, this is not a terrible wage. It’s not a fair wage, but it doesn’t shock me,” says Ramapriya Gopalakrishnan, a labor lawyer based in the nearby city of Chennai. To rent a room in the towns surrounding the factory would cost around one-third of a worker’s monthly paycheck, she says. “To support two kids in school on top of that, and support a mother and father, it would be very difficult.” Read More:The Workers Behind AI Rarely See Its Rewards. This Indian Startup Wants to Fix That Before the beginning of each daily shift at Foxconn’s Sriperumbudur factory, Foxconn managers announce production targets. Some days, according to two assembly-line workers, the targets can require each worker to work on as many as 520 iPhones per hour—or one every seven seconds. At those rates, each worker on the production line could handle some $4 million worth of iPhones every day. Every worker on this assembly line has a designated task. Some are experts at attaching a specific component to the iPhone’s motherboard. Others have learned the precise finger movements necessary to tighten an individual screw. At regular stages some workers perform quality checks, to make sure nothing has gone wrong as each phone barrels from one point along the assembly line to the next. Meena, a contract worker on the factory floor, says she spends eight hours per day, six days per week, hunched over her station, fingers constantly in movement. “Some days, I don’t even get time to go to the restroom because I have to meet my production targets,” she says. “If the supervisor notices that products are piling up on the conveyor belt at my stage, he will reprimand me.” Her delicate task—the specifics of which, like her real name, TIME is not revealing in order to protect her identity—causes pain in her fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, and back, Meena says. If she changes her position to alleviate the pain—for example by crossing her legs—a supervisor will often hassle her to sit properly, she says. Foxconn allows workers facing health issues to take short rests and provides them with over-the-counter pain medication, Meena says. But after her rest break, Meena says she is still expected to continue at a demanding pace for the rest of the day. Meena is not employed directly by Foxconn. Instead, like many of her colleagues in the factory, she is employed by a third-party contractor. This system is not unique to Foxconn, according to Gopalakrishnan, the labor lawyer. It’s common in the Indian manufacturing sector, she says, because it helps factory owners maintain a flexible workforce to which they bear few legal obligations. “Unlike fixed-term employees, these so-called contract laborers do not know even whether they can earn their livelihood beyond tomorrow—that is the degree of uncertainty we are talking about,” says Gopalakrishnan. “This whole contract labor system is designed to lower labor costs and evade responsibility for compliance with labor laws.” At the Sriperumbudur factory, contract workers do not receive sick leave or vacation days, and are not given copies of their contracts, according to three who spoke with TIME. Foxconn earlier this year instituted a new policy there, the workers said, whereby if contract workers take leave on a consecutive Monday and Saturday, their monthly salary will be docked by 1,500 rupees ($18), the equivalent of several days’ pay. And if workers take three days of consecutive leave, their salary will be docked 5,000 rupees ($60), the workers said. This appears to describe more violations of Apple’s supplier code of conduct. Apple says in the document that it holds its suppliers to the “highest standard” of labor. It specifically says that they must not use wage deductions as a form of discipline, must not prevent workers from taking bathroom breaks, and must take steps to mitigate “ergonomic hazards” including painful postures and repetitive movements. In statements to TIME, neither Foxconn nor Apple commented on the allegations of wage deductions, poorer conditions for contract laborers, ergonomic hazards, or high production targets. “We work with relevant local agencies to ensure that all recruitment efforts follow Foxconn’s recruitment standards and guidelines, as well as local labor regulations,” a Foxconn spokesperson said. “Foxconn communicates and cooperates with stakeholders, wherever we are, to continuously create an operating environment that is healthy and competitive, while protecting the rights and interest of our employees.” “We have the highest standards in the industry for our suppliers and regularly assess their compliance to our code of conduct,” an Apple spokesperson said. “With multiple feedback channels, including employee surveys and anonymous reporting, we are constantly looking for ways to raise the bar even further.” Back at the perimeter of the Foxconn factory complex, past the mounds of dirt and the skeletal frame of the half-constructed warehouse, beyond a security hut manned by guards in white shirts, are two rows of what appear to be worker housing buildings. Both rows are four stories high and 100 meters long, and lined with concrete balconies. These buildings may be a taste of what is to come. With Apple keen to ramp up iPhone production in India, Foxconn isreportedlyplanning to build huge hostels for as many as 60,000 workers near its Sriperumbudur factory. Construction is currently under way on a large plot of land inside the Foxconn complex. As a result, workers at the factory are concerned that Foxconn may again require its employees to live in company-run hostels, and could revoke the 5,000-rupee ($60) housing allowance that it currently pays its workers to cover the cost of their outside accommodation, according to three workers who spoke with TIME. (Foxconn declined to comment on its plans.) Meanwhile, the most expensive iPhone 14 retails for $999. The most expensive iPhone 15 retails at $1,099. While Apple does not publicly disclose the difference between an iPhone’s final sale price and how much it costs to produce, the company’s most recent financialresultssay that for every dollar of income from product sales, the company makes around 35¢ as profit. The four workers at the Sriperumbudur factory who spoke to TIME said that while it’s unlikely they would easily find higher wages elsewhere, they still feel they deserve better. It would take the lowest-paid among them around six months to save enough to buy a single iPhone 15—and that’s if the worker never paid for rent, food, or to support her family. “When I compare my salary to the cost of an iPhone, obviously they can pay me better,” one young woman says. —With reporting by Barath Raj/Sriperumbudur and Varsha Bansal/Bengaluru",en

Poland finished building this fence a year ago to try to stem an influx of migrants assisted to the border by Belarusian soldiers, whose government is trying to destabilize Europe. BIALOWIEZA, Poland — Hiking through the Bialowieza Forest is a journey through prehistoric Europe. It's one of the last remaining old-growth forests on the continent, home to the rare European bison. It's not bison that stop hikers in their paths these days, though. It's Europe's newest border wall: a 15-foot-tall metal fence topped with razor wire and security cameras demarcating the line between Poland and Belarus. Poland finished this 116-mile wall a year ago in response to an uptick of migrants illegally crossing the border. For years, the government of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has facilitated Belarusian visas for migrants from throughout the Middle East and Africa,escorting them to its borderwith the European Union in an attempt to destabilize Europe. Now that EU-memberPoland has built a wall, Belarus has turned to other tactics. In August, Polish news reports showed footage of two military helicopters from Belarus flying over the border into Polish — and NATO — airspace. ""They're really watching us closely,"" says Katarzyna Zdanowicz, a spokesperson for the Polish Border Patrol. ""They're testing our border wall. We are always anticipating what they'll do next."" Zdanowicz says these incidents started in earnest in May. ""Since then, events take place several times a week along the border,"" she says. ""Just yesterday there was an attack, the day before yesterday there was another attack. Yesterday a group of about 60 people gathered on the Belarusian side and threw stones at our border officers."" Zdanowicz says soldiers on the Belarus side of the border are always provoking their Polish counterparts and often supply bricks and stones to migrants to throw over the wall at Polish Border Patrol vehicles. She shows pictures of broken patrol car windows and infrared videos of these attacks. Her officers will soon have help. After Poland's government saw evidence that the Russian Wagner mercenary group was training along the Belarus side of the border, Poland's prime minister announced he'dsend 10,000 additional soldiersto secure the region. Some political analysts criticized this, saying the ruling right-wing party Law and Justice was exaggerating the threat to secure votes for October's national election, but military analystMarek Swierczynskisays the threat is very real. ""Belarus has evolved from a difficult neighbor to a hostile neighbor,"" he says. Swierczynski says Poland is exposed tohostile forcesalong much of its eastern border. First, of course, there is Ukraine, a country invaded by Russia. Poland must also manage the threat from Belarus, as well as its border with the Russian territory of Kaliningrad. Between Kaliningrad and Belarus, Poland and Lithuania share a 70-mile border called the Suwalki Gap, a narrow corridor connecting the Baltic states with the rest of the European Union. Loading... ""So in any case of crisis or, God forbid, conflict,"" says Swierczynski, ""keeping this stretch of land in control of native forces is crucial for any reinforcements of the forward-deployed NATO forces and for the defense of the free Baltic states."" Swierczynski calls the Suwalki Gap ""the Holy Grail"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin. If there were ever a conflict between Russia and NATO countries, analysts say Putin would likely attack this stretch of land first. And that's why Poland is taking this latest threat from Belarus seriously. Magdalena Ostrowska stands in front of her restored 19th century hotel and restaurant in Bialowieza, along Poland's border with Belarus. Tensions along this border have meant that Ostrowska's revenue has been cut in half. She says guests cancel their reservations because they are scared of Polish media reports that say Russia's Wagner militia is training just beyond the border in Belarus.Rob Schmitz/NPRhide caption Magdalena Ostrowska stands in front of her restored 19th century hotel and restaurant in Bialowieza, along Poland's border with Belarus. Tensions along this border have meant that Ostrowska's revenue has been cut in half. She says guests cancel their reservations because they are scared of Polish media reports that say Russia's Wagner militia is training just beyond the border in Belarus. For those living along the border, none of this is good news. Magdalena Ostrowska walks up a spiral staircase to the top of a century-old water tower that's been converted into a hotel room. It's empty; as are many rooms here at her restored 19th-century hotel along the border, outside the town of Bialowieza. ""When the media reported that soldiers from the Wagner Group were across the border, tourists called us and canceled their reservations,"" she says. ""They told me they were too afraid to come. I told them there's nothing to worry about. It's peaceful and quiet here, as you can see, but they didn't listen."" Ostrowska says her revenue was cut in half this year because of the drop in tourism. What's worse, this comes after the COVID-19 pandemic and a year when this region was blocked off from the public by the military to deal with the migration crisis. ""And now we're waiting for what's next,"" she says, shaking her head. ""Will they lock down this area again because of another incident? This is our future, our jobs. It doesn't seem fair."" A few miles away in downtown Bialowieza, tour guide Nina Zin says she's also lost money because of the border threat, which she thinks is hyped by the Polish media and has been turned into a political spectacle by the government. ""The government said they won't give an inch along this border,"" she says, ""but the helicopter from Belarus flew three full kilometers inside of our country, crossing a NATO border without permission! And we didn't even respond."" Calling out the Polish government for hypocrisy on its tough border stance now appears to be even more in order. Poland's deputy foreign minister was recently fired after his department was caught selling Polish work visas to migrants from across the developing world. The scandal is unfolding as the Law and Justice party has put border security at the center of its reelection campaign. ""They built this reality in which this is a very big problem,"" says political analystAndrzej Bobinski. ""And now we find out that they're a big part of the problem."" Bobinski says the narrative that Law and Justice — known inside of Poland as PiS — has constructed around migrants and safe borders has now blown up in its face. ""So this doesn't play very well with the Law and Justice narrative about how Poland is a place that's been closed away from the outside world and how PiS is safeguarding our frontiers and not allowing for these scary people to come and change our way of life,"" he says. And whether it's from Belarus, Russia, or from a visa fraud scandal, threats to Poland's ruling party are mounting. And an election is fast approaching. Piotr Zakowiecki contributed to this report in Poland. Tensions are high on the border of Poland and Belarus as Belarus has been weaponizing migrants and recently staging military exercises that havre violated Polish and NATO airspace.",en

<ul><li>Backyard tiny homes, called ADUs, are becoming increasingly popular.</li><li>Despite the interest, it can be hard to finance o… [+6331 chars]",Finance,"Backyard tiny homes, called accessory dwelling units or ADUs, are becoming more popular as some state and local governments roll back zoning restrictions. But financing ADUs is still a struggle as mortgage guidelines have not caught up. That's because government-backed mortgage providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac set the strict standard for all other mortgage lenders. ""Until Fannie and Freddie says 'We can take a property with an ADU on it,' then a lot of lenders are going to be scared of doing that, scared of repackaging that loan for Fannie or Freddie in the future,"" said Ryan O'Connell, founder of How To ADU, an ADU advocacy organization in California. Even with these restrictions, there are ways to pay, he said. Check zoning laws to see if ADUs are allowed in your area, and if they are, here are some avenues that could help finance one. If you're lucky enough to have between $100,000 and $400,000 in cash lying around — the range in cost for a typical ADU — then you can potentially finance your ADU without taking out loans. It will get it done faster, increasing your property value while allowing you flexibility on how to use it (rental property, home for adult children, downsizing). If you rent it, the income will go directly into your pocket — no loan payments necessary — and will eventually make up for the cash that you've put in at the beginning. The prospect of using savings can be daunting. Even on the low end, that's more than the cost of a 20% down payment on the average home in the US, which was $420,000 in August,according to Redfin. As the housing shortage becomes more dire, states and local governments are trying to come up with ways to spur housing development — quickly and affordably. Three states — New York, California, and Vermont —fund ADU developmentor improvement through grant programs. But read the fine print carefully. Only certain people qualify, and in some cases the funds must go toward specific parts of the project, making it likely you'll have to find additional financing for your ADU. Also, some people that have received the grant told Insider thatthe process can be arduous. Some cities, counties, and local nonprofits are providing funding to help homeowners build ADUs. For example, a neighborhood in Denver, Colorado, has a nonprofit that ishelping homeowners with ADU costs, the Denver Post reported. In Napa County, California, residents can receive a forgivable loan for a portion of the project if they commit to renting the unit out at an affordable rate designated by the county for five years. Because ADUs are a relatively new concept, it can be tricky to get a bank to fund one. It's getting easier, though. Fannie and Freddie have been pulling back its restrictions on funding ADU projects, O'Connell said. Some local banks are coming up with creative ways to help homeowners finance this, he added. For example, his local bank — Redwood Credit Union, in California — sets aside funding specifically for loans for ADUs. The interest rate is around 4%, O'Connell said. That's much lower than the typical mortgage rate. Additionally, you can complete the whole project without paying interest, he said, through their deferred payment program. Sometimes, when financing an ADU loan, programs like RCUs may consider the property's worth after the ADU is constructed when underwriting the loan. It allows homeowners to access more funding than they would be able to otherwise. The drawback to this method is that there is a patchwork of policy — these local bank programs vary widely, if they exist. Still, it's worth investigating whether your local bank or credit union has a program that works. There are several third-party providers that partner with local banks to offer some ADU financing. The finance technology company RenoFi is an example of this. They operate nationally, but in California, specifically, ""they have engineered partnerships with credit unions"" to essentially finance the same type of loan that a credit union like RCU has, O'Connell said. RenoFi gives you up to 90% of the future value of your home. Some can take out private loans to fund theirADUs. This has gotten trickier to do, though, with high interest rates. O'Connell said that more people are borrowing against their retirement, including taking a loan out of their 401(k) accounts. While some may see that as a faster route, it's crucial to note: Insider's personal finance deskdoes not recommend drawing a loan out of your 401(k)unless it's a last resort, including paying off high-interest debt, or in an emergency situation. Neither of these situations include building an ADU. You can also team up with a parent, child, sibling, or friend toget an ADU built. Two bank accounts are better than one. A mother-daughter duo in the Bay Area told Insider about their experience doing this last year. Mother Barbara Clark and her husband were planning for retirement, and realized they could not pay their high mortgage on a fixed income. Meanwhile her daughter, Katie Sandoval-Clark, could not afford to live near her parents with her current income. So, Clark and her husband paid for the down payment on a new home, and for the ADU with the funds that they got selling their old home. Sandoval-Clark and her husband will pay the mortgage each month. Clark and her husband moved into the main home, and Sandoval-Clark and her family live in the ADU. Now, Sandoval-Clark gets to raise her children near her grandparents, and eventually, the two families will swap as the two children get older. This kills two birds with one stone — and, as O'Connell noted, comes with the added perk of a free babysitter for the coming decades.",en

Mapimpi was injured in a clash of heads with Augustine Pulu in the Springboks’ 49-18 Pool B victory over Tonga in Marseille on Sunday, which edged them closer to a quarter-final place. The incident was reviewed by the Television Match Official, but not sanctioned with a yellow card. ""Makazole is out of the World Cup,"" Erasmus told reporters. ""We know who we want to replace him, I would love to tell you who it is but we first need to notify World Rugby. ""It is very sad, it was an accident, but he has a fractured eye socket and he is out for four to six weeks. We will miss him because he is a brilliant rugby player and a fantastic person."" While no longer first choice in the side, Mapimpi has bags of experience having played a central role in South Africa’s 2019 World Cup victory in Japan. ""If we get to the final we will fly him back to join us here. It is sad but that is the game of rugby, these collisions happen,"" Erasmus added. South Africa must wait until Saturday’s game between Ireland and Scotland in Paris to learn their quarter-final fate, but are in a strong position. The only way they can be knocked out of the tournament is if Scotland beat top-ranked Ireland by 21 points or more and the latter get a bonus point for tries scored. If Scotland win by eight points or more with no Irish bonus point then they and South Africa advance. ""We would rather sit here than be Ireland, who have been number one in the world all this time and Scotland just have to beat them by eight points and they are out of the tournament,"" he said. ""Of the three teams, we are probably the most comfortable.""  ",en

Only England and Wales have sealed a spot in the knockout rounds, meaning it is all to play for across the four groups. Head-to-head records will separate teams who are level on points in the first instance, while if three sides finish even then points difference is used to select the top team, before it reverts to head-to-head for the two remaining nations. We look at the permutations across the pools. POOL A France 13 points, New Zealand 10, Italy 10, Uruguay 5, Namibia 0 It is possible the top three teams finish level, which would favour New Zealand to go through on points difference and Italy to advance past France on head-to-head. Any sort of win for Italy over France should be enough, unless the latter pick up two bonus points (one for losing by seven points and the other for scoring four tries). The most likely scenario is New Zealand beat Uruguay on Thursday and finish second, with France defeating Italy a day later to top the pool. A draw would also be good enough for the hosts. POOL B South Africa 15 points, Ireland 14, Scotland 10, Tonga 0, Romania 0 If Scotland beat Ireland by 21 points or more in their final fixture in Paris on Saturday, and the Irish earn a bonus-point, then those two will advance and knock out defending champions South Africa, who have played all their fixtures. But if Ireland get two points from the game, they will advance as group winners with the Springboks in second. A win by eight points or more with no Irish bonus point will see Scotland go through on head-to-head and Andy Farrell’s world number one side ousted from the tournament. POOL C Wales 14 points, Australia 11, Fiji 10, Georgia 3, Portugal 2 Wales have already qualified for the quarter-finals and will top the pool even in defeat with a bonus point against Georgia. Fiji need just a point from their clash with Portugal on Sunday to finish second, which will see Australia, who have played all their matches, exit the World Cup in the pool stages for the first time. POOL D England 14 points, Argentina 9, Japan 9, Samoa 6, Chile 0 England have secured top spot in the pool, leaving a winner-takes-all shootout between Argentina and Japan in Nantes on Sunday for second place. Argentina have a superior points difference. However, if Japan take a bonus point for four tries scored in a draw, and Argentina do not, they will advance. Samoa have the slimmest of chances. They must hope for a draw in Nantes, beat England by 29 points or more and gain a bonus point to advance on points difference with all three teams on 11 points.  ",en

Mumbai, India– Attending a World Cup is on the wish list of every cricket fan. The opportunity comes once every four years, the wait is long and arduous, it might be expensive – but in the end, it’s worth it. Many fans in India had hoped to attend theCricket World Cupon home soil, but the organisers’ delay in announcing the final schedule and a chaotic ticketing process have forced many to give up on their dream. The International Cricket Council, cricket’s global governing body and organisers of the World Cup, released the fixtures on June 27; just 100 days before thestart of the tournamenton October 5, when defending champions England take on New Zealand in the opener in Ahmedabad. The delayed announcement was met with backlash from fans asschedulesfor the last two ODI World Cups in Australia and New Zealand (2015) and England and Wales (2019) were put out more than 12 months in advance. Then on August 9, less than two months out from the start of the tournament, the 2023 World Cup organisers made things even more complicated for fans by releasing a revised schedule. The dates or start times were changed for nine matches, including the highly-anticipated India vs Pakistan fixture in Ahmedabad, which was moved to October 14 from its original date of October 15. The changes to the schedule werereportedlyover security concerns and requests from participating countries. Match tickets for the general public went on sale in a staggered manner only from August 25, a mere 41 days before the opening match. And the process to book tickets was far from hassle-free – fans had to first register to be able to book tickets and then wait for hours before they could have a chance to buy them. And for many, the chance never came.      Mayank Batra, a cricket fan in New Delhi, had booked a flight for October 15 to attend the India-Pakistan match in Ahmedabad but was forced to cancel it after the fixture was rescheduled. The 28-year-old made a fresh travel booking for the new date, but even that was in vain as he failed to get his hands on the match tickets. “There has been a lot of mismanagement. Several people had already booked their travel and couldn’t get hold of the match tickets,” Batra told Al Jazeera. Batra said his initial round-trip flight tickets cost him 30,000 Indian rupees ($360), but prices went up after the match was rescheduled, with one-way tickets costing 23,000 Indian rupees ($277). “Eventually I cancelled my refundable flight tickets and instead booked train tickets. But I couldn’t get match tickets so my plan didn’t work out,” Batra said. Late changes to the fixture list also led to inflated accommodation costs, with prices for some hotel rooms in Ahmedabad soaring by more than 12 times the usual cost, with rooms as expensive as 53,000 rupees ($637) a night in three-star hotels. Meanwhile, those lucky enough to get their hands on match tickets can also face huge prices. The cost of World Cup tickets starts from 499 rupees ($6) and goes up to 40,000 rupees ($481) on the official ticketing platform. The prices in the resale market are exorbitant, with the most expensive ticket for India vs Pakistan selling for 25 million rupees ($300,545) on Viagogo, a multinational ticket exchange and ticket resale brand. The situation is also likely to affect fans travelling to India from abroad. Some fans from the Barmy Army, an England cricket supporters club, are expected to skip the World Cup due to the difficulty in planning the trip. Meanwhile, fans from other countries face visa difficulties – most significantly for neighbouring cricket-mad Pakistan. Batra, who has travelled across India to watch cricket, said travelling to Sri Lanka last month to watch India play Pakistan in the Asia Cup would have been cheaper. India faced Pakistan twice in the Asia Cup, beating them by 228 runs in the Super Four clash after their group-stage game was called off due to rain. “Even a one-day trip to Colombo would have cost me less than travelling to Ahmedabad [as per the current prices],” Batra said. “The match tickets for that match in Colombo were also very cheap and Indians have visas on arrival in Sri Lanka.”  Anish Desouza, an ardent cricket fan from Mumbai, hoped to attend six matches at the World Cup but had to cancel his plans due to the limited availability of tickets and the high expenditure involved. Desouza, who co-founded the North Stand Gang, a fan group named after the stand they sit in at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium, wanted to attend matches in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Kolkata. But tickets were hard to come by, he said. “The way the ticket sales were handled was very shoddy,” Desouza said. “The waiting in a queue system was very unfair to fans because we had to wait for over four hours only to come to know the tickets were sold out.” Well-travelled sports fan Vipul Yadav described the management of the ticketing process as “nonsensical”. “The amount of time I have spent on booking matches … it’s crazy,” Yadav said. “Nowhere in the world, do you have to struggle so much for a ticket. All this has happened because the ticket release has been done too late.” Yadav will be travelling to Paris for the Olympic Games next year and said the process for booking tickets for that event was very straightforward. “The process was so good, they [organisers] make it so easy for you. They give you a week’s notice about the tickets going on sale, 48 hours to book and also keep slots open for you,” Yadav said. The ICC, which is yet to announce how many World Cup tickets have been sold so far, did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the issues raised in this article. BookMyShow, the official ticketing platform for the Cricket World Cup, released astatementlast month on X, formerly known as Twitter, addressing the issue of “limited tickets”. “We understand that not all fans had an easy time, experiencing queues and eventually heartbreak in their attempt to book tickets. In a country like India, which is deeply passionate about cricket, the demand is always massive as scores of fans try to book tickets with queues naturally tending to be long,” the company said. “While it is always a race against time to get access to this cricketing extravaganza, we are striving to be able to give you a fighting chance to get access to the tickets.” According to BookMyShow’s website, more tickets for India matches will be “coming soon” and tickets for some matches involving other teams, such as England, Pakistan and Australia, are still available on the platform.    Desouza, who attended the 2011 ODI World Cup in India, said the ticketing process was hassle-free at that time. “The tickets for the 2011 World Cup were available well over a year in advance,” he said. “The process was very smooth. There was no waiting time.” He compared that with his experience of trying to buy a match at the Wankhede Stadium. “Tickets were very hard to come by. When a stadium has 33,000 capacity and you release only 500 tickets, that is ridiculous,” Desouza said. “I am not mincing words because it is surely unfair for fans like us.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",en

The footage was posted to X on September 29 by the account OSINTtechnical, a page run by a person affiliated with theCenter for Naval Analyses. Insider couldn't verify or locate the footage itself. Per the OSINTtechnical post, it shows a T-54 or T-55, which were first developed into 1945 and have been obsolete for decades. The tank is marked with the Z symbol associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On top is a flimsy wooden structure that roughly doubled the tank's height. It was covered with dried grass, perhaps as camouflage. Early model T-54/55 sporting an impressively tall cope cage in Russian service.pic.twitter.com/kfuaDGn4BQ The apparent source of the post — aRussian channel called ""Let's Help the Front""gave the clip the apparently sarcastic caption ""maskirovka,"" the Russian term for its doctrine of military deception. OSINTtechnical called the attachment a ""cope cage"" — a mocking nickname for structures but around tanks in the hope they could protect against drones, missiles, or other anti-tank weapons. Cope cages have generally been dismissed as ineffective, andprobably wouldn't helpagainst common anti-tank weapons like the Javelin or NLAWs, the CEO of therisk-intelligence firm Sibyllinetold Insider in 2022. ""They give them psychological protection against weapons, but actually, they do very little,"" said Justin Crump, the CEO. Ubiquitous videos of burning tanks with ""cope cages"" still attached suggest that the analysis is correct. Despite its age, it wouldn't be totally surprising to see a Russian T-54/55 tank is getting rolled out on the frontline. Russia has been known topull out old tanks from storageto shore up its inventory after heavy infantry losses in the Ukraine war. A recent report by the respected Royal United Services Institute suggested that Russia's old tankswere still proving useful in some scenarios. Per its analysts, the tanks would be no good in a direct confrontation with newer tanks, but can still work providing indirect fire like an artillery gun.",en

<ul><li>Melissa Kwan is the CEO and co-founder of eWebinar. </li><li>She says she doesn't have to answer to anyone else because she's bootstrapped. <… [+5161 chars]",Startups,"I've built three startups over the past 13 years and consciously chosen not to raise venture capital for any of them, also known as ""bootstrapping."" I chose bootstrapping because it lets me live a life that puts my happiness ahead of maximizing profits, which for me, is the life/work balance that makes building a startup sustainable. Currently, I'm the co-founder and CEO ofeWebinar,an automated webinar platform that helps companies run hundreds of webinars without needing to be there to host them live. Here are 8 unconventional ways I get to live my life because I didn't take VC money: I start my day at noon, go out for dinner, and work until midnight. I don't wake up with an alarm. I run errands when I need to and take naps when I feel like it. I take time off whenever I want, including every birthday. My life partner is my cofounder. We travel nine months of the year and work on the road. We give everything for this company, but externally, it looks like we're always having fun and doing very little. I don't have the stress of needing to justify our relationship and how we spend our time to a board. No VC can tell us to get an office and hire locally to prove their money is well spent. We have a team of contractors who set their own hours. We believe people are most productive when they choose where they live and when they work. Also, I prioritize lifestyle over revenue and don't attend events I don't want to. I don't attend networking events, conferences, or booths. I have a zero-call policy; no sales calls, no support calls — no exceptions. All communication is through email or chat. We optimize for happiness, not dollars. It took us 36 months to hit $1 million annual recurring revenue. We spent time listening to feedback and built something customers love so they'd stick around because we didn't need to manufacture growth for investors. And because it was the only way to build a sustainable business. Since I don't have to worry about keeping up my public image for fear of negatively impacting fundraising, I can share my honest opinion with anyone I want without worrying about backlash. My answer to how things are going doesn't always have to be ""I'm killing it!"" As the sole director and board member, I can make decisions around hiring and firing execs, budgeting, compensation, investments, corporation structure, stock options, dividends distribution, selling shares, exiting – as I see fit for the business. A common misconception with bootstrapped companies is that they raise zero capital. In truth, they often choose to raise capital or sell a portion of their shares much later when there is significant revenue. If we ever take this path, it'll be on our terms. This is the most important yet most underrated item on this list. I wouldn't have been able to sell my previous startup if we had VCs because the price would be too low for venture-level returns. I can't imagine working years towards a life-changing exit, only to have someone who never spent a day in my business tell me I can't. If that happened, I wouldn't be living as freely as I do now and wouldn't have cofounded eWebinar. I was living in New York, and every startup founder I knew was raising money, so I thought that was the only path to success. Ironically, because nobody would fund my last company and we had to sustain our own growth, we became laser-focused on generating revenue and eventually hit profitability. I realized then how liberating it is to not rely on someone else for survival. As it turns out, the only ""funding"" we needed was from paying customers. As I was building a company on my terms, my VC-backed founder friends were constantly stressed over growth rates and how they were going to raise the next round of funding. I had complete freedom and they had very little. Growing a company with limited resources means you're constantly making tradeoffs between where you can and cannot invest in your business. And as a founder, you may not be able to pay yourself for years. That kind of sacrifice is not for everyone, and sometimes I do wonder whether it'd just be easier to raise capital. But then I think about the way I get to live everyday as a result of having no boss, and I know I made the right decision. Many people think bootstrapping is a financial decision. For me, it was an intentional lifestyle choice. I asked myself, ""What kind of life do I want to live if I am going to build this company for the next 10 years?

According to Freedom House’s new report, Freedom on the Net 2023: The Repressive Power of Artificial Intelligence, governments are using automated systems to ramp up online censorship, while distributors of disinformation are using AI tools to fabricate images, audio and text. In at least 22 countries, says the report, legal frameworks require digital platforms to use machine learning to remove political, social and religious speech that doesn't support national ideology. ""AI can be used to supercharge censorship, surveillance and the creation and spread of disinformation,"" says Michael J. Abramowitz, president of Freedom House. ""This is a critical issue for our time, as human rights online are a key target of today’s autocrats. Democratic states should bolster their regulation of AI to deliver more transparency, provide effective oversight mechanisms and prioritize the protection of human rights."" The report warns that even democracies are relying too heavily on the industry to regulate itself, and calls on policymakers to develop strong human rights standards for both state and non-state players—including robust transparency and independent oversight. ""When designed and deployed safely and fairly, AI can help people evade authoritarian censorship, counter disinformation and document human rights abuses,"" says report coauthor Allie Funk, Freedom House’s research director for technology and democracy. ""The lessons we have collectively learned from the past decade of internet policy discussions—regarding government oversight, the need for robust global civil society engagement and the problem of overreliance on self-regulation—provide a promising roadmap for this new era."" Over the last year, Iran's score worsened the most, as authorities shut down internet services and blocked social media to stifle anti-government protests. Meanwhile, the Philippines, Belarus, Costa Rica and Nicaragua also saw significant declines. However, finds the report, people in at least 55 countries faced legal repercussions for expressing themselves online, and governments in 41 countries blocked websites hosting political, social and religious speech. Overall, China kept the dubious honor of having the world’s worst environment for internet freedom for the ninth year in a row—although Myanmar, where death sentences have been carried out for crimes related to online expression, gave it a run for its money. On the brighter side, Iceland kept its place as the best environment for internet freedom for the fifth consecutive year, followed by Estonia. Sri Lanka showed the biggest improvement, with the authorities removing the blocks on social media platforms that it put in place in April 2022 during mass anti-government protests. The report highlights the U.S. as the world leader in attempting to combat spyware, with an executive order earlier this year banning federal agencies from the operational use of commercial spyware products that pose a threat to national security or counterintelligence, or that could be employed by foreign governments to violate human rights or target people from the U.S. ""While this is a welcome step forward, the White House should work with Congress to make the order’s provisions permanent law through bipartisan legislation, ensuring that the prohibition remains in place under future administrations,"" reads the report. The EU, meanwhile, should follow its example: ""Robust action from Brussels would send a very strong signal to spyware purveyors that their irresponsible trade will no longer be tolerated, particularly those operating within the EU’s borders,"" the authors say.",en

Lewis' book on the rise and fall of Bankman-Fried's FTX, ""Going Infinite,"" is set to be published on Tuesday. The author, who has penned books on finance such as ""The Big Short"" and ""Flash Boys, told ""60 Minutes"" that to write the book, he interviewed Bankman-Fried more than a hundred times. Lewis told ""60 Minutes"" that from his time spent with the FTX boss, he thought Bankman-Fried's wealth appeared to have attracted ""everybody,"" all of whom wanted to be his ""best friend.""

The result, which leftPresident Joe Bidendemandingswift action to fulfill Kyiv’s needs, made for a good weekend for Russian President Vladimir Putin. But it left Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with plenty more to worry about after shifts elsewhere in global politics played into Moscow’s push to outlast the West in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Biden suggested he had a “deal” with McCarthy on moving assistance for Ukraine in a separate measure, but the Republican speaker’s office declined to confirm any such agreement. Drama in the US coincided with another development this weekend that will cause concern in Ukraine. In neighboring Slovakia, former pro-Russia Prime Minister Robert Fico’s populist partywon parliamentary elections. Fico anchored his campaign on his anti-US rhetoric, vows to stop sending weapons to Ukraine and a pledge to thwart Kyiv’s NATO ambitions. Blows to Ukraine in the US and Slovakia came on top of its spat over grain exports with Poland – one of Kyiv’s earliest and most staunch allies – which led Warsaw to warn it could stop arms shipments to its neighbor. Each of these developments stresses a rising danger for Ukraine – that the arms and aid it needs to sustain its fight against Russia’s onslaught are increasingly getting dragged into the bitter politics of national elections in the West. Any sign of weakening resolve for arming Ukraine among Western leaders and legislatures is an added incentive for Putin to try to extend the conflict into a war of attrition in the hope that Western publics will tire of the fight and that leaders like ex-President Donald Trump might win power next year and ditch Kyiv. The headlines are alarming for Ukraine. And while the realities of international politics suggest that time is not yet running out for the remarkable pipeline of arms and aid that fueled its heroic resistance to Russia’s onslaught, the political ground could be shifting and augur serious long-term concerns for Kyiv. In Slovakia, Fico’s SMER party won Saturday’s parliamentary elections in a swing of the political pendulum back toward the populism and nationalism that delivered Trump, Brexit and gains by far-right parties in France and Germany in recent years. In the glow of victory, Fico warned, “Slovakia and people in Slovakia have bigger problems than Ukraine,” and added he would push for peace talks. Slovakia, a member of NATO, was previously a vocal ally of Ukraine, and a turn against its neighbor would hand Putin valuable propaganda openings. Yet on its own, Slovakia has no power to push negotiations to start. In any case, there’s no sign Ukraine is ready to talk as its offensive grinds on, or that Putin has any political or strategic motivations to do so either. And Fico has to worry about his own coalition-building before he starts deciding Ukraine policy. And a Slovakian halt to arms shipments is unlikely to tilt the battlefield toward Russia. It did send Kyiv old Soviet MiG jets and other equipment for which it was compensated by the European Union. But its contributions are dwarfed by those of larger European powers and the United States. A threat to block Ukraine’s entry into NATO sounds alarming. But the NATO summit this year showed that there is no prospect of Kyiv joining the Western alliance soon anyhow. And even before the Slovakian election, getting all alliance members to back its eventual membership was already a struggle. Turkey, for instance, is still blocking the accession of Sweden, a far less controversial new member of the self-defense club. Slovakia might be home to many voters sympathetic to Moscow givenits decades as part of the former Czechoslovakia in the Warsaw Pact under the iron grip of the Soviet Union.But as a NATO member, it is still dependent on the group – and, ultimately, the US – for its defense. And its economy is reliant on its European Union membership. This gives the West substantial leverage in Bratislava. Geopolitical realities may also be decisive in Poland’s dispute with Ukraine. Many analysts believe temperatures will cool after a tense election later this month. Poland’s antipathy to Russia and desire to prevent it from winning a victory in Ukraine are borne out of decades of bitter political history unlikely to be diluted by shifting political winds. And its posture is also critical to its rising importance to the United States as one of Washington’s most important European allies. Zelensky’svisit to Washingtonto shore up Ukraine aid last month looks prescient. But after a wild week, it’s clear that future tranches of US assistance will be far harder for the Biden administration to drive through Congress. McCarthy, whose speakership is wobbling,pushed througha stopgap spending bill to keep the government open through mid-November, without $6 billion in Ukraine funding the Senate hoped to add to the package – which in itself represented only about a quarter of Biden’s latest Ukraine aid request. The move will not immediately imperil Ukraine on the battlefield, but a longer delay could have serious consequences. And politically, it could embolden Putin and fuel doubts about US staying power in the war among allied European leaders who are standing firm but also need to manage public opinion. Some of Ukraine’s loudest supporters in Congress were deeply disappointed. “Putin is celebrating,” Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois told CNN. “I don’t see how the dynamics change in 45 days.” The co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus was the only House Democrat to vote against the stopgap measure. House Republican rebels, some of whom arethreatening to topple McCarthyafter he used Democratic votes to temporarily keep the government open at current spending levels, are largely opposed to more aid for Ukraine. They include Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and pro-Trump Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who wrote on social media Saturday that “Joe Biden treats Ukraine as the 51st state” after previously warning that more funds for Kyiv would be “blood money.” Ukraine refused to panic over the interruption to its latest injection of aid in a multi-billion-dollar initiative on which its war effort largely depends, at least in its current scale. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said his country is working with the US Congress on the issue. “We do not feel that US support has been shattered, because the US understands that what is at stake in Ukraine is much bigger than just Ukraine. It’s about the stability and predictability of the world, and therefore I believe that we will be able to find the necessary solutions,” Kuleba said. The danger for Zelensky is that such rhetoric solidifies into a sense among voters that American interests and Ukraine’s interests are opposite. At Republican campaign events, voters often voice antipathy to sending billions of dollars to Ukraine, and polls show rising public skepticism. Still, for now, there is a bipartisan Washington majority in favor of Ukraine aid, although the chaos in the GOP raises questions about how it will be delivered. Biden on Sunday seemed to indicate he had a deal with McCarthy on moving the funds in a separate bill, although the speaker may be too weak to deliver on any promises. “I fully expect the speaker to keep his commitment to secure the passage and support needed to help Ukraine as they defend themselves against aggression and brutality,” the president said. McCarthy suggested that a framework that also sends more money to secure the southern US border might open the way for Ukraine funds. “They’re not going to get some package if the border is not secure,” the speaker said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “I support being able to make sure Ukraine has the weapons that they need. But I firmly support the border first. So we’ve got to find a way that we can do this together.” But if McCarthy is toppled and replaced by a more radical speaker, Ukraine could run out of luck. Longer term, the US elections in November 2024 are critical. Trump, the Republican front-runner, has vowed to end the war in 24 hours if elected president, presumably on terms that would favor Putin, whom he has called a “genius” and before whom he has often genuflected. And Ukraine’s would not be the only future on the line. A second Trump term could pose an existential threat to NATO and the entire post-World War II and Cold War concept of the West.",en

The town hall's announcement on X, formerly known asTwitter, came after Francisco Jiménez, the central government's official for the region, earlier said all the missing had been located and no more bodies had been found. Jiménez later said there had been confusion in the figures for the missing. Jiménez said the dead included the nationals ofSpain, Colombia, Ecuador and Nicaragua. It was not known how many people were in the club when the fire broke out at 6 a.m. Sunday. It was the deadliest nightclub blaze in Spain since 43 people were killed in Zaragoza in 1990. On Monday, firefighters and police continued to assess damage before beginning to search for clues as to how the fire started. The blaze started in one nightclub and spread to two others nearby, Spanish state news agency EFE said. All the bodies were found in the first nightclub. Twenty-four people were injured but none was hospitalized. Murcia town hall reported that authorities had rejected permit renewals for the two nightclubs and ordered them closed in 2022. The city said it would investigate how the clubs had continued operating. Representatives of the clubs denied on Spanish national television that they had been operating illegally. The city council declared three days of mourning with flags flown at half-staff on public buildings. A minute's silence was held outside Murcia´s town hall at noon Monday.",en

When the city first came under siege, the alarms would have sent them rushing to the nearest underground shelter, where they'd wait out the shelling. Now, more than500 days later, the dancers have learned to ignore the sirens. The wails have become part of their soundtrack as they prepare for showtime in Ukraine's easternmost major city, only 15 miles from the Russian border. By mid-afternoon, nine women have gathered around the dance pole at Flash Dancers, the only women-owned exotic dance club in Kharkiv. Prostitution is illegal in Ukraine, putting strip clubs in a legal gray area. But the law was seldom enforced even before the war — the country boasted one of the most thriving sex-tourism scenes in Eastern Europe, with an estimated80,000 sex workersin 2016. Today, with Kharkiv'spolice preoccupiedwith defending the city from Russian saboteurs and helping with the fallout of missile strikes, Ukrainians seem to accept that a modicum of vice might need to be tolerated, or even embraced, amid the grindingausterity of war. ""Our goal is to be a switch from what is happening,"" says Valeriya Zavadskaya, the club's 24-year-old co-owner. Under the club's dim red lighting, Valeriya leads the dancers through a rehearsal as Christina Aguilera's ""Express"" blares over the PA: E-X-P-R-E-S-SLove, sexLadies, no regrets ""One, two, go backwards,"" Valeriya orders. ""Take two steps and then dobam! bam! bam!"" With her arms stretched behind her head, she demonstrates the move, lifting herself upside down onto the pole, splitting her legs, spinning in midair, and landing on beat. One dancer looks stupefied. She tries the move but barely gets airborne before stumbling. ""I won't do that,"" she says. ""Yes, you will!"" says Valeriya, demonstrating again. Over the next two hours, with indefatigable drill-sergeant precision, she works the dancers through each pop and pirouette of the routine, as Aguilera's power ballad plays on a seemingly endless loop: All ladies confident, flaunt itBoys throw it up if you want itCan you feel me? Can it feel it? It's Burlesque Valeriya shouts the last line as she navigates the dancers through the song, changing ""burlesque"" to ""Flash Dance."" That's the name Valeriya's mother, a former professional Soviet dancer, gave the club when she opened it a decade ago. (""Express,"" a song from the movie ""Burlesque,"" in which Cher plays a nightclub owner and mother figure to Aguilera's character, is a wink to their mother-daughter proprietorship.) The signs of war are everywhere. The windows on the three floors above the club remain boarded up after an explosion last year in the center of Kharkiv shattered every window on the block. Because Flash Dancers is in the basement, it doubles as an air-raid shelter, where staff members and tenants living above the club can wait out rocket strikes in the red-leather booths surrounding the dance pole. The club has lost three employees to the war, two of them a married couple who met there. More than a million residents have fled Kharkiv, and few who remain can afford to spend an evening at Flash Dancers, where a drink costs three times what it did before the war. There are never more than 20 guests. On some nights, no one shows up. Yet despite a strict 11 p.m. curfew mandated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the club remains open seven nights a week. At this point it's not a living, it's a lifeline — part of a nationwide, defiant attempt at normality in the midst of war. As Valeriya leads the dancers to the dressing room to change into the night's costumes, she talks about why she fell in love with the world of dance her mother introduced her to. It also sums up what the club strives to offer beleaguered patrons and employees alike. ""It's something you can't say with words,"" she says, ""but can tell with your body."" A few hours before rehearsal, I meet with Valeriya's mother, Valeriia Kseniya, in her office at her day job, as director of a small hotel a short drive from the club. ""For most of us in Ukraine today, it's difficult to earn a living in just one job,"" she says. We sit on the couch as she displays pictures from her life in show business — dancing with a chimpanzee in her days with a Chinese circus group, sauntering at a cabaret in South Korea. Every few minutes we can hear the lull of a train carrying soldiers and civilians passing through the railway station next door. Growing up in Kharkiv under Soviet rule, Kseniya found herself ""irritated by reality."" She worked as a gymnast for the Komsomol, the communist youth league, and tried to focus on the joy of performance and ignoring the Communist Party. By the time the Iron Curtain fell and Ukraine gained its independence in 1991, she was 23. For much of the next two decades she was frequently on the road: dancing in clubs in Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia, modeling lingerie in Italy, touring with ballet troupes in Asia. By 2014, with a teenager and a toddler in tow (she also had a grown son, who works in Ukraine's energy sector and was then 23), Kseniya decided to settle in Kharkiv. That spring, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and orchestrated a rebellion of its Donbas region, plunging Ukraine into a recession. Inflation approached 30%, while unemployment climbed to nearly 11%. But for Kseniya, the timing was fortuitous. A strip club in the center of the city was going out of business. Here was her chance, she thought, to bring the world of dance home. With visions of building a modern-day Moulin Rouge, the legendary 19th-century Parisian cabaret, Kseniya hired a handful of attractive women who knew how to dance, and then began choreographing elaborate, acrobatic numbers set to American and Europop songs. The police were suspicious: In the club's first year, they showed up multiple times to question her and the dancers about whether Flash Dancers was a front for a prostitution ring. Patrons expecting strip-club fare, meanwhile, were flummoxed by the unusual customer experience. ""Everyone initially thought it was a club with happy endings,"" says Kseniya, now 55. The choreography looks more like that of a modern dance company than the Hustler Club, the dancers do not get topless, and sex with customers is strictly forbidden. ""Our position is that girls are not meat,"" Kseniya says. ""Girls are about aesthetics, about femininity, about beauty."" Eventually, the club built a reputation for its performances — several pre-2022 Google reviews appear to be from women who took their husbands to the show (""wonderful, soulful atmosphere!"" one wrote) — and the business grew. In 2020, needing a business partner she could trust, Kseniya brought on Valeriya as co-owner. Then early in her studies at the National University of Kharkiv, Valeriya was majoring in dance and law. (""Dance is for your soul,"" she explains. ""Law is forever."") She took on an after-hours leadership role at the club, choreographing new numbers, helping manage the books, and running the club's Instagram and TikTok feeds. Then came Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kharkiv immediately became a brutal battleground, battered by relentless shelling and cluster bombs. On the day of the invasion — February 24, 2022 — Kseniya and Valeriya reached all 20 dancers. Many were already fleeing. Most would not return. With the city under siege, Kseniya continued working at the hotel to help lodge civilians who were waiting in huge numbers to leave the train station. In the first two weeks, some600,000 people, more than a third of the city, left by rail alone. On March 8, after Russian fighter jets bombed several nearby homes, Kseniya joined the exodus. She and her daughters — accompanied by Valeriya's lapdogs, Sara and Lady — journeyed 15 hours by train to Drohobych, near the Polish border. There, they waited to see whether they would one day have a home to return to. In May 2022, after nearly three months of fighting, Ukrainian troops pushed Russian forces away from Kharkiv. Valeriya and her family returned to find parts of their city unrecognizable, and the rubble-strewn streets quiet. Rocket strikes and shelling had damaged or destroyed apartment complexes, government buildings, churches, an opera house, a concert hall, and an economic building at the university where Valeriya was finishing her degree. The stone walls of the Flash Dancers facade were pockmarked with shrapnel.More than 600 civilianswere thought to have been killed in the Kharkiv region. Nearlyhalf of all businessesin Ukraine shut down, and 90% of Ukrainians were facing poverty. But Kseniya refused to let Flash Dancers sit empty. She decided to reopen it with the cash she had left from the club's earlier success. And once again, she found herself grimly fortunate. Though she and Valeriya had to replace almost all of the club's staff, many women who had been working at local restaurants and strip clubs were now looking for jobs. ""Everything was closed, and people began to come to us,"" Valeriya said. Few of them, however, had ever danced. Now, in the afternoon before the club opens, Valeriya cleans the toilet, calls the plumber to fix a leak, and makes sure the bar is stocked and the prices are set for the evening. With inflation, liquor costs up to three times what it did before Russia's full-scale invasion. ""We have a huge markup on everything,"" says Valeriya. Thirty minutes before the club opens for the evening, the dancers are gathered in the dressing room. Some are putting on their makeup; others shimmy into a wide array of erotic costumes: a maid's outfit, a police uniform, frilly French cancan skirts, a black sequined ball gown. The mood is buoyant. It all feels very far from the war-ravaged streets aboveground. I sit next to Dana, a 23-year-old Kharkiv native who asked that Insider use only her first name to protect her privacy, as she slips into a pair of white-feathered angel wings. Before the war, she worked at a strip club in the city. Now, she feels relieved to be working in a club owned by women — one that isn't a place ""where everyone tries to touch you."" Flash Dancers is different, attempting to strike a balance between art and entertainment. ""I'm not ashamed of it,"" Dana says. ""I can tell people I work in cabaret."" When Dana first joined Flash Dancers, Valeriya said, she was shy, silent, and not open to speaking with the team. For many of the new, wartime employees, the challenge hasn't been just the difficulty of the routines. It's a lack of confidence and self-esteem. ""They don't believe in themselves,"" Kseniya says. Part of that, she believes, stems from a lack of positive feedback growing up — ""complications that were given to them by their parents as part of the USSR heritage."" But part of it comes from the ongoing fear and uncertainty created by the war. Valeriya and her mother both make a point of complimenting the dancers frequently. Kseniya does their makeup, and Valeriya makes and tailors their outfits, so the exact fit ""helps their confidence."" Still, setting aside the traumas of war while they're at work is a daily battle for everyone at Flash Dancers. ""You have to smile when you don't want to,"" Valeriya says while inspecting a dancer's mascara. ""You have to entertain when you don't want to."" Gyrating to the Pussycat Dolls in pumps and a sheer pearl-sequined leotard while your country is under attack doesn't come naturally to anyone. Valeriya often reminds the dancers that their customers — many of them Ukrainian soldiers — are in dire need of a distraction. Making sure ""they leave with positive emotions"" is good for the cause — and for tips. ""When the military comes in, they're so tense,"" Kseniya says. ""It's really, really tough."" Occasionally they have to toss out an unruly man. But most are cordial. Many of the soldiers ask the dancers to sit with them, and the night becomes more group therapy than cabaret. They talk about their children and wives who have fled the city, the lives they've left behind, their own floundering businesses, what they've seen on the battlefield. Dancers sometimes get more tips from listening than from dancing. One night back in March I met a 26-year-old soldier named Yurii Tryfan who sat alone wearing camo fatigues, nursing his Jägermeister. He told me he had just come from Bakhmut, the besieged city that has witnessed some of the most vicious fighting of the war. (Yevgeny Prigozhin, the now-deceased head of the Russian private army Wagner, claimed he hadlost 20,000 of his fightersin Bakhmut alone.) Tryfan was reluctant to talk, but he had nothing but praise for the club and the solace it provided. ""Amazing place,"" he says. ""Wonderful staff, the best girls. And most importantly, the core lineup, the songs."" Over the past year, several soldiers who were regulars at Flash Dancers have been killed in the fighting. And the horrors of war have reached beyond the front lines. Last September, a dancer named Lyuda, one of the few who remained from before the war, went into labor. She was living in the commuter town of Kupyansk, which had fallen under Russian occupation soon after Russia invaded. She and her husband, Maksyum, a bartender she had met at Flash Dancers a few years earlier, left their home headed for the hospital. On their way, Russian soldiers shot at the car, killing them both. That same month, Pavlo, the club's business administrator, was shot dead by Russian soldiers while driving in Bakhmut. At 6 p.m. sharp, the Flash Dancers sign outside the club lights up. Kate, a 19-year-old host who's majoring in English at a nearby college, hands out flyers to passersby. She's wearing a long red dress, red wings, and a red masquerade mask. No one bites. Inside, the dancers chat before the dance floor's mirror. The International Monetary Fund says the Ukrainian economy has begun to show signs of ""remarkable resilience"" as critical infrastructure has been restored and inflation has begun to come down. And though Ukrainians have little spending power, nightlife is resurgent. In Kyiv, according to some reports, there are now more bars and restaurants open than there were before the war. Still, fewer than half of all small businesses in Ukraine are operating at full capacity, and inflation remains punishingly high. ""Prices are constantly going up even now. It's scary,"" Kseniya says. She fears that if rates continue to climb, ""people will stop going."" The evening at Flash Dancers could serve as a microcosm of Ukraine's tentative but determined return to normality. By 7, two men trundle down the red-carpeted staircase. As more trickle in, some women take turns dancing while others sit with them, offering them company as they watch the performers. At 9 p.m., just after sunset and with barely an hour before close, a large group arrives. In the final hour, there's an avalanche of constant, acrobatic motion around the pole — syncrhonrized spins and shimmies and sashays as Aguilera croons. When one dancer finishes onstage, another immediately replaces her. ""We've sped up the relaxation process"" for the customer, Valeriya says, by ""distracting him with a beautiful fuss around him."" ""We reopened the club to create another world, where everything is magical,"" Valeriya says. ""Diamonds and rhinestones do the trick."" Anna Conklingis a journalist based in Berlin.

Sanjeev Sanyal , a Member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, while speaking at the Africa Partnership Conference in Mauritius, emphasised on the importance of having clear Environmental, Social & Governance ( ESG ) norms. The two-day Africa Partnership Conference envisaged to spur cross-boundary collaboration, which kicked off in Mauritius on October 2, will be an ideal platform for Indian stakeholders to pursue wider bilateral trade and strategic goals. Sanyal in his address, stressed that  ESG norms  would soon have a significant impact on various aspects of our global landscape. While the term ESG is widely recognized, precise norms have yet to be established. Currently, ESG norms are being defined by various ad hoc groups and NGOs. However, Sanyal underlined the urgent need for globally recognized ESG norms and effective monitoring of their implementation. Sanyal also said that India is keen to take the lead in forming ESG norms in line with their efforts with assigning sovereign ratings to countries worldwide. He said that, traditionally sovereign ratings have been dominated by the three private companies such as Moodys, Standard and Poor, and Fitch. India's own rating agency, Care Edge, has successfully developed a methodology for the same. Over the next few months, Care Edge aims to rate approximately 40 countries, with plans to complete ratings for the rest of the world by March 2024. India intends to replicate this approach for defining and rating ESG norms. Sanyal also discussed India's economic growth amid global geopolitical changes and the post-Covid recovery. He projected India's economy to grow at nearly 7% this year, with an expected growth rate of around 8% in the coming years. Highlighting India's massive infrastructure development, Sanyal pointed to Mumbai, where numerous metro lines and a 21km coastal road are under construction. He noted the construction of a new, world-record-breaking airport in Mumbai, set to become operational within the next 36 months. Despite India ranking 3rd in the world by PPP and 5th in USD terms, Sanyal acknowledged that per capita income remains relatively low. India aims to surpass Germany's economic ranking in the next 15 months and Japan's by the end of 2028, becoming the world's 3rd largest economy. Sanyal emphasized Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for India's growth, aiming for developed nation status by the 100th year of India's Independence.

Almost three-quarters, or 74% of Gen Z workerssurveyed by Adobein September, said they're comfortable giving upward feedback to their supervisors. And almost 90% said they were comfortable about giving feedback to their peers. The majority of respondents also said they didn't mind talking about typically sensitive topics — nearly 8 in 10 said they were comfortable with talking about their wages, and almost 9 in 10 said they were comfortable with discussing their job satisfaction at the workplace. For the report, Adobe surveyed 1,011 US Gen Z workers, which they defined as those born between 1997 and 2012. These respondents worked full-time for up to three years at companies with 750 employees or more. This survey adds to prior research that shows how comfortable Gen Z is with changinglong-held workplace norms. ""Perhaps thedefining characteristicof Gen Z is that, instead of wanting to revolutionize, Gen Z is comfortable with the idea of change through structure,"" Tracy Francis, McKinsey's chief marketing officer, previously told Insider. Plus, Gen Z workers are themost likely to switch jobsand land the biggest pay increases when they do, Insider previously reported. Even the office lingo is shifting. The majority of UK respondents surveyed by Barclays Bank said Gen Z workers are makingworkplace languagemore casual — and over a third of those surveyed now consider ""yours truly"" and ""yours sincerely"" to be old-fashioned. To be sure, managers alsotold Insiderthat their Gen Z workers often struggle to focus on work and lack motivation. And nearly three-quartersof managers surveyed by ResumeBuilder.com in April said they find Gen Z employees the most difficult to work with. Over a quarter of those surveyed said they fired a Gen Z employee during that employee's first month on the job.",en

 The unemployment rate across the eurozone fell by … [+2008 chars]",Malta,"The unemployment rate in the eurozone fell by one-tenth from July to August, sitting at 6.4%. This is the lowest ever figure for the currency union, according to data released on Monday by the statistics office, Eurostat. It beats the previous unemployment record set in June this year, and is 0.3 percent lower than the rate in August 2022. For the European Union as a whole, rather than the economic bloc, the unemployment rate stood at 5.9% in August, the same as in May and June, and it was 0.1 points lower than in July.   Unemployment has fallen sharply in Europe since mid-2021, thanks to a strong economic recovery after the pandemic induced recession. This comes despite challenges for the eurozone, notably  the war in Ukraine  and high inflation rates. Which country had the best numbers? To look at the bloc's leading economies,  Germany  has one of the lowest unemployment rates within the EU. Eurostat reported this at 3%, a figure that has remained stable for the past three months. To take France, unemployment was at 7.3% in August, a slight decrease compared to the previous month. Italy had the same level of unemployment for the month of August, down by 0.1 points and 0.2 points respectively compared with July. The lowest rates in the EU were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.5%), Malta (2.7%) and Poland (2.8%). The highest rates were recorded in Spain (11.5%) and Greece (10.9%). Youth hit the hardest Young people remain the most affected by unemployment.  In August 2023, the unemployment rate of under 25s was 14% in the EU and 13.8% in the eurozone. Compared to the previous month, the data shows a minor decrease.  Eurostat numbers are based on the International Labour Office (ILO) definition of unemployment. The unemployed are defined as those who have actively sought work in the previous four weeks and are available to start work in the next two weeks. Will unemployment rates continue to decline? Unemployment rates are a strong indicator of how well economies are doing. Although such rates do not immediately react to positive or negative inputs, decreasing unemployment rates and low stable rates indicate a rather healthy economy.  Fewer unemployed people means that you are utilising more of your potential workforce, and states end up spending less on social benefits to cover lost wages. The overall euro area unemployment rate has been decreasing for the past 3 years. In August 2020, it reached 8.6%, its highest level following the COVID-19 full lockdowns implemented earlier that same year. While unemployment rose sharply because of the pandemic, the figures reached were relatively low compared to the staggering minimum 12% unemployment rate observed for all of 2013 -the highest rate on record for the euro area. The well-documented relationship between inflation and unemployment is once again showing today: as inflation has remained high in the eurozone over the past two years, unemployment has decreased. In an attempt to curb high inflation, The European Central Bank (ECB) has increased interest rates. Since the 20th September,  the ECB raised its benchmark deposit rate to 4% , the highest on record. The Euro Area inflation rate of 5.2% for August 2023, although expected to decrease in September, is well above the 2% target the ECB is aiming for. But just as unemployment and inflation rates are known to react with one another, interest rates also play a role. The higher they are, the more consumers and businesses may be reluctant to spend, eventually leading to higher unemployment. For now, the ECB estimates that both unemployment and  inflation rates will continue to decrease  in the coming months.",en

In monetary terms, the trade volume amounted to $15.5 billion, while Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya were named among Russia’s top trading partners. “Africa has a rich resource base, but no production technologies; Russian technologies for developing deposits and extracting minerals are necessary,”Economy Minister Maksim Reshetnikov said in a report seen by the media.“High rates of urbanization raise demand for our experience in the construction of houses, roads and railways, ports, oil and gas pipelines, and utility networks.” Earlier this year, Reshetnikov predicted that Russian trade with Africa would double by 2030. In 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the trade turnover between Russia and Africa totalled $18 billion. At the same time, the Federation Council reported that Russian exports to African nations amounted to $14.8 billion. According to the president, machinery and equipment, chemical products, and food account for more than 50% of Russian exports to the continent. The Bank of Russia had previously reported that 12.7% of Russian exports to Africa were carried out in rubles in July 2023, while nearly 79% of payments were made in“other currencies”that mainly included the Chinese yuan, compared to 39% recorded in June 2023.

Dengue is… [+3060 chars]",Bangladesh,"More than 1,000 people in Bangladesh have died of dengue fever since the start of the year, official figures showed, in the country's worst recorded outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease. Dengue is a disease endemic to tropical areas and causes high fevers, headaches, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain and, in the most serious cases, bleeding that can lead to death. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that dengue -- and other diseases caused by mosquito-borne viruses such as chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika -- are spreading faster and further due to climate change. Figures from Bangladesh's Directorate General of Health Services published on Sunday night said 1,006 people had died, among more than 200,000 confirmed cases. The agency's former director Be-Nazir Ahmed told AFP Monday that the number of deaths so far this year was higher than every previous year combined since 2000. ""It's a massive health event, both in Bangladesh and in the world,"" he said. The new figures dwarf the previous highest total from 2022, when 281 deaths were recorded for the full year. Among the dead are 112 children aged 15 and under, including infants. Scientists have attributed this year's outbreak to irregular rainfall and hotter temperatures during the annual monsoon season that have created ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes. Bangladesh has recorded cases of dengue from the 1960s but documented its first outbreak of dengue haemorrhagic fever, a severe and sometimes fatal symptom of the disease, in 2000. The virus that causes the disease is now endemic to Bangladesh, which has seen a trend of worsening outbreaks since the turn of the century. Most cases are recorded during the July-to-September monsoon season, the months which bring the vast majority of the country's annual rainfall, along with occasional floods and landslides. However, in recent years, hospitals in Bangladesh have also begun to admit patients suffering from the disease during winter months. Those with repeat infections are at greater risk of complications. Mohammad Rafiqul Islam, a doctor at Dhaka's Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College, said most patients admitted at his hospital were suffering their second or third cases of dengue. ""When people have dengue for the second, third or fourth time, the severity is increased. The number of deaths are also higher,"" he told AFP. ""Many are coming to us when it's already late in their illness,"" he said. ""Then it's really complicated to treat them."" Dengue wards in Dhaka's major hospitals are filled with bedridden patients lying beneath mosquito nets, under the watchful and worried eyes of family members. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in September the outbreak was ""putting huge pressure on the health system"" in Bangladesh. The agency's alert and response director, Abdi Mahamud, said the same month that such outbreaks were a ""canary in the coal mine of the climate crisis"". He said a combination of factors, including climate change and this year's El Nino warming weather pattern, had contributed to severe dengue outbreaks in several areas, including Bangladesh and South America. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa such as Chad have also recently reported outbreaks, he said.",en

What's intriguing about the discovery is that these objects appear to be moving in pairs. Astronomers are currently struggling to explain them. The telescope observed about 40 pairs in a fabulously detailed new survey of the famous Orion Nebula. They've been nicknamed Jupiter Mass Binary Objects, or ""JuMBOs"" for short. One possibility is that these objects grew out of regions in the nebula where the density of material was insufficient to make fully fledged stars. Another possibility is that they were made around stars and were then kicked out into interstellar space through various interactions.  ""The ejection hypothesis is the favoured one at the moment,"" said Prof Mark McCaughrean. ""Gas physics suggests you shouldn't be able to make objects with the mass of Jupiter on their own, and we know single planets can get kicked out from star systems. But how do you kick out pairs of these things together? Right now, we don't have an answer. It's one for the theoreticians,"" the European Space Agency's (Esa) senior science adviser told BBC News. Prof McCaughrean led the team that produced the new Orion survey. Using JWST's remarkable resolution and infrared sensitivity, the astronomers have added substantially to the information already mined by older telescopes, including Webb's direct predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope. The Orion Nebula, also known by its sky catalogue name of M42, is the nearest, large star-forming region to Earth. Along with the quartet of bright suns at its centre called the Trapezium, this region of space is visible to the naked eye as a smudge on the sky. If you don't know it, it can be found low down in the constellation of Orion, which is named after a mythical Greek hunter. The nebula forms part of the hunter's ""sword"", hanging from his ""belt"". The new JWST image is actually a mosaic of 700 views acquired by Webb's NIRCam instrument over a week of observations. To give a sense of scale, it would take a spaceship travelling at light speed a little over four years to traverse the entire scene. The nebula itself is about 1,400 light-years from Earth. Tucked away in this vista are thousands of young stars, spanning a range of masses from 40 down to less than 0.1 times the mass of our Sun. Many of these stars are surrounded by dense discs of gas and dust which may be forming planets, although in some cases, these discs are being destroyed by the intense ultraviolet radiation and strong winds from the most massive stars in the region, in particular from the Trapezium. The slider tool on this page shows the same nebula scene at shorter and at longer wavelengths. Using different filters in this way emphasises items of interest. Look at the longer wavelength version to examine the sculpted green clouds of gas that contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. PAHs are ubiquitous compounds in space produced by stars.  Look also at the many-fingered red feature that dominates the background. Known as the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 outflow, this is a mass of molecular hydrogen that has been shocked by the the immense energy streaming away from the site of a cataclysmic collision of two giant stars. The speed of the outflow at more than 100km/s indicates the star merger occurred just a few hundred years previously.  Notice the fingertips are tinged with green - a marker for gaseous iron. There is so much to peruse and probe in the full-sized survey image which is 21,000 by 14,500 pixels. But it is the JuMBOs that have caught the immediate attention of astronomers. ""My reactions ranged from: 'Whaaat?!?' to 'Are you sure?"" to 'That's just so weird!' to 'How could binaries be ejected together?'"" recalled Dr Heidi Hammel who was not on the survey team.   She said there were no models of planetary system formation that predicted the ejection of binary pairs of planets. ""But... maybe all star formation regions host these double-Jupiters (and maybe even double-Neptunes and double Earths!), and we just haven't had a telescope powerful enough to see them before,"" the multidisciplinary scientist on JWST told BBC News. Esa will be posting the full image of M42 on its EsaSky portal which allows anyone to explore publicly available astronomical data.

She might be listening from above,"" Kariko said.Thomas Perlmann, the secretary general of the Nobel Assembly, called Kariko ""an extraordinary and unusual scientist"" who ""resisted any temptation"" to do ""something easier"".Weissman told AFP he heard the news from Kariko, who received the call from the jury first.""We were wondering if somebody was pulling a prank on us,"" he said.""This is the ultimate—this is the prize I thought of when I was five years old when I started to get interested in how things worked,"" he added.BreakthroughIn the 1990s, Kariko believed mRNA held the key to treating diseases where having more of the right kind of protein can help—like repairing the brain after a stroke.But the University of Pennsylvania, where Kariko was on track for a professorship, demoted her after grant rejections piled up.She carried on as a lower-rung researcher.Much of the scientific community was at the time focused on using DNA to deliver gene therapy, but Kariko believed that mRNA was also promising since most diseases are not hereditary and don't need solutions that permanently alter our genetics.First though, she had to overcome the problem of the massive inflammatory response in animal experiments, as the immune system sensed an invader and rushed to fight it.Kariko and Weissman discovered that one of the four building blocks of the synthetic mRNA was at fault—and they could overcome the problem by swapping it for a modified version.They published a paper on the breakthrough in 2005.In 2015, they found a new way to deliver mRNA into mice, using a fatty coating called ""lipid nanoparticles"" that prevent the mRNA from degrading and help place it inside the right part of cells.Both these innovations were key to the COVID-19 vaccines.Nobel Committee member Olle Kampe said the prestigious prize may help sway the opinion of some anti-vaxxers.It ""may make hesitant people take the vaccine and be sure that it's very efficient and safe"", he told AFP.The technology is now being used to develop other treatments for cancer, influenza and heart failure, among others.Kariko and Weissman will receive their Nobel diploma, gold medal and $1 million check in Stockholm on December 10.The Nobel will however not be the first gold medal in Kariko's family.

She might be listening from above,"" Kariko said.Thomas Perlmann, the secretary general of the Nobel Assembly, called Kariko ""an extraordinary and unusual scientist"" who ""resisted any temptation"" to do ""something easier"".Weissman told AFP he heard the news from Kariko, who received the call from the jury first.""We were wondering if somebody was pulling a prank on us,"" he said.""This is the ultimate—this is the prize I thought of when I was five years old when I started to get interested in how things worked,"" he added.BreakthroughIn the 1990s, Kariko believed mRNA held the key to treating diseases where having more of the right kind of protein can help—like repairing the brain after a stroke.But the University of Pennsylvania, where Kariko was on track for a professorship, demoted her after grant rejections piled up.She carried on as a lower-rung researcher.Much of the scientific community was at the time focused on using DNA to deliver gene therapy, but Kariko believed that mRNA was also promising since most diseases are not hereditary and don't need solutions that permanently alter our genetics.First though, she had to overcome the problem of the massive inflammatory response in animal experiments, as the immune system sensed an invader and rushed to fight it.Kariko and Weissman discovered that one of the four building blocks of the synthetic mRNA was at fault—and they could overcome the problem by swapping it for a modified version.They published a paper on the breakthrough in 2005.In 2015, they found a new way to deliver mRNA into mice, using a fatty coating called ""lipid nanoparticles"" that prevent the mRNA from degrading and help place it inside the right part of cells.Both these innovations were key to the COVID-19 vaccines.Nobel Committee member Olle Kampe said the prestigious prize may help sway the opinion of some anti-vaxxers.It ""may make hesitant people take the vaccine and be sure that it's very efficient and safe"", he told AFP.The technology is now being used to develop other treatments for cancer, influenza and heart failure, among others.Kariko and Weissman will receive their Nobel diploma, gold medal and $1 million check in Stockholm on December 10.The Nobel will however not be the first gold medal in Kariko's family.

<li>The ""Shark Tank"" star warns a CRE downt… [+2838 chars]",Real estate,"Pressure is building on regional banks, commercial real estate developers, and small businesses, Kevin O'Leary has warned. ""It's getting worse by the week,"" the ""Shark Tank"" investortold Fox Businesson Friday. ""Lots of private equity firms are admitting there's cracks in the system."" The Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates from nearly zero to north of 5% over the last 18 months, in a bid to cool inflation which hit a 40-year high of over 9% last summer. Steeper borrowing costs have pulled down the value of commercial properties and weighed on debt-reliant developers,fueling a credit crunchas banks balk at lending to the sector. Regional banks in particular arefeeling the squeeze, as they're the main lenders to the CRE space, and have seen the value of the real estate and bonds on their balance sheets tumble as rates have climbed. Smaller banks are also a key source of financing for small businesses, which are weathering a painful period of stubborn inflation, costlier debt, and lingering fears of a recession. ""We're going to see more cracks in regional banks, and that's putting pressure on the loan books of those banks which are hitting small business,"" O'Leary said. Many CRE developers face the prospect of refinancing their loans within the next three years at interest rates of 9% to 14% a year, compared to between 3% and 5% when they first borrowed the cash, the celebrity investor said. ""That makes these buildings uneconomic,"" he noted, underscoring that the pain in the CRE sector would have knock-on effects on regional banks and small businesses. O'Leary – whose nickname is ""Mr. Wonderful"" — cautioned that if banks run into trouble, businesses with over $250,000 in their payroll accounts might pull their money out en masse, or be left unable to pay their employees. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. only guarantees a maximum of $250,000 per account holder at any one bank if the lender becomes insolvent. ""You don't want a regional bank failing because you can't past $250,000 guarantee it,"" O'Leary said, adding that many payroll accounts have well over $250,000 in them ahead of payday. The founder of O'Leary Funds and O'Leary Ventures urged lawmakers to support a $100 million guarantee for non-interest-bearing accounts, which would protect payroll accounts. ""They've got to have some plan for when these banks start failing,"" he said. O'Leary hasrecently touted the S&P 500given the tailwind of aggressive government spending,sounded the alarm on the triple threatfacing the US economy, andwarned mortgage rates could surge past 8%if the Fed lifts rates to north of 6%.",en

""We vehemently denounce and reject the abnormal behavior of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) which has been completely reduced to a reptile organization that serves the U.S. away from its elementary mission as an international organization to maintain impartiality,"" an unnamed spokesman for North Korea's Ministry of Nuclear Power Industry said in astatementMonday, as per state media Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). ""If the IAEA wants to avoid international criticism as a paid trumpeter of the U.S., it would be well advised to devote itself to tackling the difficulties facing the international community,"" the spokesperson added. The spokesperson argued that North Korea had already withdrawn from the IAEA in the early 1990s, which means the agency has ""neither qualifications nor justification"" to question the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for its sovereign decisions. The statement also criticized ""the U.S. and its followers"" for supposedly fabricating a resolution that was ""full of hackneyed and far-fetched assertion by abusing the name of an international organization."" The DPRK's remarks came after a resolution wasadoptedFriday at the conclusion of the 67thIAEA General Conference in Vienna, Austria. The said resolution called on North Korea to suspend its nuclear programs that ministers of the Group of 7 (G7) nationssaidin July were activities that posed ""a grave threat to regional and international peace and stability, and undermine the global non-proliferation regime."" The IAEA has had no access to North Korea since 2009, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in an Augustreport. He added that North Korea has not yet dropped its nuclear programs ""in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner,"" adding that the nation did not cease all activities related to the programs. Seven years before the agency lost access, Pyongyang announced its decision to expel IAEA inspectors who were monitoring the country's frozen nuclear facilities. At the time, the North Korean government told the organization that it would resume work on processing spent fuel rods at a facility that was capable of manufacturing weapons-gradeplutonium– a ""valuable energy source when integrated into the nuclear fuel cycle,"" as per the World Nuclear Association. A U.S. officialtoldCNN at the time that Pyongyang's move only meant that the authoritarian country was ""isolating itself from the world."" As the 67thIAEA conference was in full swing, North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un said in aspeechduring the ninth session of the 14thSupreme People's Assembly that the country's nuclear force-building policy ""has been madepermanentas the basic law of the state."" He said the ""historic event"" will provide North Korea with a ""powerful political lever"" that will strengthen the country's national defense arsenal.",en

On one hand, the fall season is a sign that the year is winding down. Anyone who wants to finish off their backlog of games released in 2023 before the 2024 flood begins needs to start finding ways to cut down their backlog. Though there are even more pressing matters in October: it’s spooky season! With a month-long Halloween celebration in full swing, October is also the perfect time tomarathon some creepy games. Usually, that might mean going back to play some classics likeSilent Hill 2, leaving little room to catch up on new games. But what if you could kill two vampires with one stake? Well, you can this year because 2023 has been a wild year for horror video games. From two high-profile remakes to a slew of indie greats, your backlog this year might already be full of great, creepy games. To help organize your October, we’ve put together a list of seven eerie 2023 releases that double as great Halloween games. You can fly your freak flag and cut down your list of game to play in one go — that’s efficiency! If you only have time to play one horror game this month, make sure it’sResident Evil 4. It’s not just a nostalgic remake of one of the finest Resident Evil games of all time, but also a fiendish reinvention that stands on its own two feet. Capcom’s latest doubles down on the original’s horror-action gameplay by making Leon S. Kennedy deadlier than ever. He’s a true action hero, parrying flying axes and roundhouse-kicking people’s heads clear off. It’s still a horror game at its heart though, full of disgusting parasites and enormous monsters that can obliterate Leon. Even if you’ve already beaten it this year, now’s a good time to jump back in. As a bonus,Resident Evil 4‘s newSeparate WaysDLCis a solid extra chapter that lets players cause some more bloodshed with Ada Wong. Resident Evil 4alone would have made 2023 a banner year for horror games, but it isn’t the only great genre remake in town.Dead Spacealso got the remake treatment earlier this year, and it’s just as much of a can’t-miss experience. While it’s much more of a 1:1 upgrade of the original, the remake ups the ante with a grotesque flesh system that let’s Isaac Clarke peel his necromorph foes like bananas. It’s downright disgusting — and that’s exactly why you should play it this month. The Dead Space series offers some masterful body horror, making it one of the more unsettling mainstream horror series’ you can play. Pair that with some legitimately great jump scares and a dose of psychological torment and you’ve got the recipe for a perfect Halloween game. If you’re squeamish, but still want to play something eerie this month,Dredgeis the way to go. At first glance, it looks like a normal fishing game where players pilot a boat and reel up some undersea creatures. There’s something much creepier under the surface, though.Dredgeis aLovecraftian horror gamethat gets weirder the more you play. Not only is the sea full of monsters and mutated fish, but players also have a sanity meter that they need to manage. When it runs out, they’ll start seeing illusions in the ocean that are sure to put them on edge. While it isn’t full of jump scares,Dredgeis a slow-burn psychological horror experience that’ll stick with you long after you play it. With how loaded 2023 has been, I couldn’t blame you if you missedAmnesia: The Bunker. The survival horror game launched quietly earlier this year, losing some of its spotlight to bigger games likeResident Evil 4. That’s a shame, because the latest Amnesia game is perhaps the scariest I’ve played this year. In this game set during World War I, players find themselves trapped in a dark bunker. They need to find an escape while dodging terrifying enemies that persistently stalk the dark corridors. What’s especially spooky is that the entire bunker runs on a generator that players need to keep fueled up at all times. When it runs out of gas, all of the lights go out. It’s a perfect late-night game so long as you’re prepared for some wild nightmares afterward. While not exactly a horror game,Lies of Pstill fits nicely into the Halloween season. The bizarre action-RPG turns Pinocchio into a Soulslike. That may sound hilarious on paper, but the end result is actually as freaky as Dead Space. Players need to battle through a dark world full of mechanical puppets that are out for blood. Each creature is an absolute abomination — and a deadly one at that. From evil donkeys to maniacal parade masters, each boss is a total creepshow that you’ll want to plunge your sword into (and we know thebest weapons to get that task done). If you’re looking for some more traditional monsters to slay, how about some vampires?El Paso, Elsewhereis full of them, making it an ideal game for the season. Inspired byMax Payne, the third-person shooter is a retro throwback that has players blasting their way through a supernatural hotel with slow-motion powers. It’s a dark neo-noir that calls back to films likeBlade. There’s a lot more to it than mindless vampire shooting, though.El Paso, Elsewhereis one of this year’s most narratively rich games, commenting on drug addiction, breakup grief, and more. It’s a must-play (and you can do so easily if you have Xbox Game Pass, as it’s included on the service). You don’t need to be an action game aficionado to get some digital thrills this month.Oxenfree 2: Lost Signalsis a perfect pick for those who want a less physically demanding gameplay experience. The supernatural narrative adventure game follows Riley, who returns to her hometown to investigate some mysterious radio signals. As you can imagine by the fact that it’s on this list, things get a little creepy from there. With choice-driven dialogue and simple exploration, players can sit back and enjoy an atmospheric ghost story without fiddling with controls; it’s like an interactive young adult horror movie.",en

Lagos, Nigeria– On October 14, 2008, the former US Secretary of State Colin Powell joined Nigerian singer Olu Maintain on stage at the Africa Rising Festival in London to dance to Yahooze, arguably the hottest record out of Nigeria at the time. The dance racked up headlines on both sides of the Atlantic. “He traded statecraft for stagecraft,” Foreign Policy’s David Kenner wrote. It was also a seminal moment for the burgeoning but mesmerising genre known as Afrobeats, long before its global domination today. It also highlighted the significant role London would play as an amplifier of the genre that grew from the streets of Lagos. In doing the Yahozee dance, Powell, one of the most idolised Black men in the world even after hisOctober 2021 deathfrom COVID-19, had unwittingly given a stamp of approval to an ode to flamboyance underwritten by internet fraud. The irony washighlighted by The Guardiantwo days later. “The Nigerian hit is a celebration of that country’s most infamous export, advance-fee email fraud (sometimes called 419 fraud, after the relevant section of the Nigerian penal code),” the article read. “The perpetrators are known as “Yahoo Boys” after their email service provider of choice.” That dance – as well as the song – remains pivotal in the genre’s story arc. I think the biggest flex in the history of Nigerian Music was when Olu Maintain brought out The US Secretary of State on stage to come and dance to a song about fraud [Yahoozee]. It still keeps me up at night. — ÀGBÀ (@Oli_Ekun)December 14, 2019  In 2002, Nigeria had established the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). One of its first high-profile cases was the trial of Emmanuel Nwude, a former bank executive who impersonated the central bank governor and defrauded a Brazilian bank of $242m. Internet connectivity was on the rise and cybercafes were dotting small towns across many parts of Nigeria. Young men began trooping to cybercafes to send “Nigerian prince” letters and a culture of flamboyance from ill-gotten gains followed, so the EFCC had its hands full. The arts, too, began to take note. In 2005, Nollywood star actor Nkem Owoh released the satirical track I Go Chop Your Dollar, as the soundtrack to the movie The Master – playing an internet fraudster who dupes “greedy” white people. Authorities banned airplay of the song as its lyrics mirrored Nwude’s modus operandi. And then there was Yahooze (a derivative of ‘Yahoo’) a comeback record for Olu Maintain (born Olumide Edwards Adegbulu) who had split from the popular boy band, Maintain, three years earlier. Unlike Owoh’s song, this was a celebration of materialistic culture. After its October 2007 release, it quickly became a viral hit. Olu Maintain had struck a nerve, affected pop culture and resurrected his solo career; in 2008, Yahooze won the Song of the Year category at the Headies – Nigeria’s equivalent of the Grammys. Industry insiders say it caught on quickly because its solid production and catchy juxtaposition of “hammer” (a Nigerian buzzword for huge cash inflow) with the car brand Hummer and “one million dollars” was an unabashed celebration of an ostentatious lifestyle that people could recognise. “We were right at the peak of new millionaires, these new guys who were indoors all day but came out at night and painted the town red. That song captured the moment … [and] spoke to a lot of young people,” said Akinyemi Ayinoluwa, entertainment lawyer and partner at Lagos-based Hightower Solicitors & Advocates. All the essentials of hip-hop culture were also present in the music video – flashy cars, bling jewellery, video vixens, a posse and expensive drinks. “Our society celebrates and continues to celebrate money of all types and sources which makes things like internet fraud inevitable,” Obinna Agwu, a talent scout with Horus Music told Al Jazeera. “The artiste simply found grounds to connect with his audience.” Olu Maintain has always denied that the song glorified internet fraud. “When you create a body of art, people can misinterpret it the way they see fit … I cannot be responsible for how people interpret a work of art,” he told Nigerian daily Punch in 2018. Nevertheless, it represented another chapter in the relationship between crime and music; the Italian-American mafia bankrolled many acts in its heyday, just as South American drug lords had ballads written for them and gangster exploits have been extolled in hip-hop. Over the last decade, Yahoo Boys, too, have become grand patrons of the arts, setting up record labels and financing music projects in what is a multimillion-dollar industry. “A lot of fraud money has definitely gone into (our music), from people who wanted to genuinely clean up their acts to people who really loved the music and needed to do something to get themselves out there because a conventional label is not going to give you a deal, they do not understand your vision,” said Agwu, the talent scout. The music business is capital-intensive, and in Nigeria, where the industry still lacks adequate funding and infrastructure, upcoming artists, especially from inner-city areas, find it hard to access funds to boost their careers. Many of these musicians, born and raised in slums, turn to internet fraudsters to help fund their ambition of being the next superstar. For many Yahoo Boys, it’s a win-win situation; bankrolling an artiste allows them to launder their money and boost notoriety via songs since artistes sing the praises of their benefactors. “In Nigeria, we can say the Yahoo Boys or the internet fraudsters were the first set of people to get into talent, investing money in talent. And as a way to pay back, a lot of the talent who had benefactors who were internet scammers showed appreciation and reverence,” said Akinyemi Ayinoluwa, the lawyer. In May 2019, Nigerian rapper Naira Marley was arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) a day after he released the video to the controversial single Am I A Yahoo Boy? The song was a follow-up to Naira Marley’s argument that internet fraudsters positively affect the Nigerian economy. He has since been released but the case continues to move labourously through Nigeria’s notoriously slow legal system. In the meantime, pro-fraud songs are still prevalent despite the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation’s hard stance against them. In October 2021, an emerging act Steven Adeoye released a single Ali, about a boy who dumps school for the world of crime and becomes successful. It went on to be a hit single without any radio or TV play. With unemployment still high among young people, many Nigerian singers will continue to sing about the realities of life, industry insiders say. Afrobeats continues to announce itself on the global stage; in January 2021, Nigerian singer Burna Boy, arguably the foremost exponent of Afrobeats to the world, won the Best Global Music Album at the Grammys. On his social media accounts, footage of the dazzling jewellery around his neck and of his assortment of luxurious cars are symbolic reminders of that connection to hip-hop and the grandiose spending associated with both genres. But it is to the credit of Yahooze, the song that lit up the scene nearly two decades ago and Olu Maintain, no longer an in-demand act, that extravagance first became an accompanying export to Nigerian music.

Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, said the soldier, identified as Daniil Alfyorov, began working with Ukraine in July,The Kyiv Independent reported. The outlet reported that Alfyorov initially got in touch with Ukraine through its ""I want to live"" hotline, which Ukraine set up in September 2022 to allow Russian soldiers to give themselves up. It's not clear from the report what intelligence Alfyorov provided, but Yusov highlighted that he had convinced 11 other Russian soldiers to defect with him. Ukraine's special forces then evacuated Alfyorov to Ukrainian-held territory when Russia got suspicious and there was a risk to his life, Yusov said, though he did not say when the operation took place. In August, in another high-profile case of defection, a captain in Russia's 319th separate helicopter regimentsurrendered to Ukraine,taking a Mi-8 helicopter with him. The pilot's arrival in Ukraine was said to have marked the end of a six-month defection plot he had worked out with Ukraine that included moving his family out of Russia, asInsider previously reported. At the time, Yusov said the pilot would be rewarded with $500,000 for bringing over the helicopter and stolen fighter-jet parts. This followed Ukraine's parliament passing a law in April 2022 offering up to $1 million to Russian military personnel who manage to transfer equipment to Ukraine. The size of the reward depends on the type of equipment they hand over. Yusov said that after that operation was revealed there wasa 70% uptick in calls to the surrender hotline. The Kyiv Independent wasn't able to confirm details of Alfyorov's status in Ukraine or if he's expected to receive a reward.",en

The meeting … [+4096 chars]",Latvia,"The European Union signalled its long-term support for Ukraine on Monday as its foreign ministers convened in the capital Kyiv for a historic first gathering outside the bloc's borders. The meeting comes as disagreements grow among EU members over support for Ukraine and as Kyiv's forces make limited gains in a high-stakes counteroffensive against Russian troops. ""We are convening in a historic meeting of the EU foreign ministers here in Ukraine, candidate country and future member of the EU,"" the bloc's foreign policy Josep Borrell said in a statement online. The purpose of the meeting was to ""express our solidarity and support to the Ukrainian people"", he said, acknowledging that the gathering ""does not have the aim of reaching concrete conclusions and decisions"". Ukraine's foreign minister hailed the summit as an important signal of European support for Kyiv. ""For the fist time ever the foreign affairs council is going to sit down outside of its current borders -- outside the borders of the European Union -- but within future borders of the European Union,"" Dmytro Kuleba told reporters alongside Borrell. The EU's 27 nations have remained broadly united through the 19 months of war on their support for Ukraine, hitting Russia with 11 rounds of sanctions and spending billions of euros on arms for Kyiv. But there are now growing fears of cracks appearing within the bloc as concern also rises over the support of key backer the United States. Hungary, Russia's closest ally in the EU, could now be joined by Slovakia as a potential block to more backing as populist Robert Fico pushes for power in Bratislava after winning elections this weekend. There have also been tensions between Kyiv and some of its most strident backers on the EU's eastern edge -- most notably Poland -- over the influx of Ukrainian grain onto their markets. France's top diplomat Catherine Colonna appeared to address the concerns of wavering backing, saying the meeting was a signal to Moscow of the bloc's determination to support Ukraine over the long term. ""It is a demonstration of our resolute and lasting support for Ukraine, until it can win,"" she told reporters. ""It is also a message to Russia that it should not count on our fatigue. We will be there for a long time to come."" The foreign ministers of Hungary, Poland and Latvia did not attend the summit, a Ukrainian government official told AFP on condition of anonymity. The Polish and Latvian representatives were ill, the official said. Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot said it was ""really important to meet here today to show our solidarity with Ukraine."" Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and his army swept quickly through large swathes of the south and east of the country but were beat back from the north. In June, Kyiv launched a long-awaited counteroffensive but has acknowledged slow progress as its forces encounter deep lines of heavily fortified Russian defences. Ukraine has been appealing for more Western arms, in particular longer-range missiles, to regain territory occupied by Russian forces. Authorities have warned ahead of winter that Russia has restarted a systemic campaign of aerial attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, a strategy that last year left millions without heating or water for long periods. On Monday, Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said Russia shelled the city of Kherson in the south, critically wounding a civilian and two police. Separately, Kyiv's intelligence service said in a statement that Ukraine's drones at the weekend had struck a plant that produces cruise missiles in the western region of Smolensk. ""Three out of four drones hit the target, causing significant damage to the production facilities of the military enterprise of the aggressor state,"" Ukraine's military intelligence said in a statement.",en

Taking tohis Instagram page, he posted an image that appeared to show a computer-generated version of himself, with the message: ""BEWARE!! There's a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it."" Hanks has spoken out about theuse of AIin film and TV before. In April,he told UK comedian Adam Buxtonthat the industry has been bracing itself for the rise of AI for some time. ""We saw that there was going to be this ability to take zeros and ones inside a computer and turn it into a face and a character. Now that has only grown a billionfold since then, and we see it everywhere,"" he told Buxton. Insider reached out to Hanks' representatives for comment but didn't immediately hear back. The use of AI, especially when used to recreate an actor's likeness, has been a central issue in theSAG-AFTRA actors strike. Actors are trying to agree on limits on how studios can use the new technology in their new contracts. Striking actors have accused studios of asking for full discretion over anydigital replacements of background actors. Hollywood writers have alsotaken issue with the technology. The long-running writers' strike was declared over after nearly five months last week when the Writers Guild of America approved a new contract. The agreement included certainprotections around the use of AI, including that content created with the technology couldn't be considered source material, something meant to protect writers from having their credit undermined by AI. Writers also can't be required to use AI software.",en

At the games five years ago in Jakarta, Indonesia, the country won 132  gold medals  and 287 medals overall. This time, into Day 9 with five full days remaining,  China  has already broken its mark for gold medals and is very close to matching the overall total from five years ago. With 290 gold medals awarded, China has won almost half — 141. Its overall total stood at 255, just short of the 287 mark set in 2018. Host nations typically get a “home field” bounce when hosting the Olympics or a large multi-sport event like the  Asian Games . ROLLER SKATING Skater Jung Cheolwon crossed the line in Monday’s 3,000-meter relay and began to celebrate thinking he’d won the gold medal for  South Korea . But he was shocked when the scoreboard showed South Korea had finished second to  Taiwan , which clocked 4 minutes, 05.692 seconds. South Korea finished in 4:05.702. Jung apologized to his teammates for his costly error. “I made a rather big mistake,” the 27-year-old Jung said. “I didn’t come at full speed to the finish line. I let my guard down too early. I am very sorry.” KURASH ENDS Uzbekistan  failed to completely dominate the ancient martial art of kurash, which has its roots in the Central Asian country. The sport debuted in the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia. Uzbekistan won four of the seven gold medals available. But China picked up two gold and Iran added another. On Monday on the closing day, Liu Yi of China defeated Zahra Bagheri of Iran 3-0 in the women's 87-kilogram division, and Sadegh Azarang of Iran defeated Kim Ming-yo of South Korea 10-0. On Sunday, Yu Dan of China won the women's 70-kilogram final against Donya Aghaei of Iran. Yu is a former judoka that China has moved into kurash because of its similarities to other martial arts. “In terms of throws and grips, there are many similarities between wresting, judo and kurash,"" Yu said. ""It has helped me a lot.” TRIATHLON Japan  completed its sweep of the trialthon gold medals by winning the mixed relay on Monday. Kenji Nener won the men's gold on Friday and Yuko  Takahashi  added the women's title on Saturday. Both ran on Monday in the winning team event, which saw China take the silver and Honk Kong the bronze. “It was tough,” Takahashi said. “I was almost dead at the end, but I gave it everything.” Many triathletes competed in the world championships in Pontevedra, Spain, on Sept. 22-24 and then rushed to China. ESPORTS Esports wrapped up Monday as one of the most talked about events at the Asian Games. Going into bronze- and gold-medal games, China led the  medal table  with three gold and four overall. South Korea had two gold and also four overall. Thailand was the only other nation with gold and also had four overall. Tawian had four overall but failed to win gold. Malaysia won the bronze on Monday in Dota 2, defeating Kyrgyzstan 2-0. China played Mongolia for the gold medal.

Prosecutors submitted acourt filingto Judge Lewis A. Kaplan on Saturday to appeal the opposition and allow two-way video conferencing because most of FTX's customers and victims are based abroad. The prosecutors wrote that Bankman-Fried's defense ""does not consent to the remote testimony."" They said: ""Due to FTX's international popularity, many of the FTX customers are dispersed across the world, making the coordination of international authorizations to permit testimony in the United States and international travel arrangements exceedingly complicated."" This particularly relates to one witness who is located in Ukraine and ""lost a substantial portion of his life savings that he had entrusted to FTX when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022."" He is referred to as ""FTX Customer-1"" in the filing. FTX Customer-1 is restricted by Ukraine's wartime law that prevents men considered fit to fight from leaving the country unless the authorities grant them permission, the prosecutors said. ""Even if that permission were to be granted, FTX Customer-1 would still need to travel by a combination of train and bus for several hundred miles through Ukraine during an ongoing war, cross a border to a neighboring country that has international flights to the United States, travel an additional distance to the nearest international airport, and then travel by air to the United States, a process that the Government estimates would take at least approximately three days in each direction,"" they added.

The Beijing-based company has already received multiple other offers. If a sale goes ahead Nasdaq-listed Hollysys would follow other Chinese companies that have recently delisted from U.S. stock exchanges as their share prices looked undervalued due to geopolitical tensions between the United States and China over trade, technology and relations with Taiwan. Hollysys offers integrated services for industrial automation and rail transport, according to its website, and its control systems have been used in sensitive areas such as nuclear power stations. In August, a consortium led by Recco Control Technology and Dazheng Group Investment Holdings made an all-cash offer of $25 per share to buy the company. The special committee will discuss the next steps with Recco Control and Dazheng Group (Hong Kong) in response to the offer to acquire the company, while expediting the process to seek ""additional serious and compelling offers,"" Hollysys said in a statement. Deutsche Bank will solicit additional potential offers on behalf of Hollysys, it added. Besides the offer from Recco Control and Dazheng Group, Reuters reported last month that a consortium led by Hollysys' management planned to take the company private in a deal that would value it at $1.8 billion. Separately, Hollysys said its board had engaged with shareholders who own 32.2 per cent of the company following their push for a special meeting in August amid mounting frustration with the management for not starting a sale process. The potential deal could also add to a growing list of U.S.-listed Chinese companies coming back to the mainland or Hong Kong in recent years as tensions mount between the two countries. Five U.S.-listed Chinese state-owned companies, including oil majors Sinopec and PetroChina, said in August they would voluntarily delist from the New York stock exchange. Shares of Hollysys, which listed in New York in 2008, have risen 20.8 per cent this year, giving it a market value of some $1.23 billion, but analysts say it is undervalued compared to a few years ago or compared to peers listed in China. Founded in 1993, Hollysys now has operations in China and eight other countries and regions throughout Asia. It has carried out more than 45,000 projects in sectors ranging from power and petrochemicals to high-speed and urban rail, its website shows. ",en

[+] establishing new behaviors as habits is no cakewalk. To foster company culture, you have to address the behaviors that underpin your culture. However, establishing new behaviors as habits is no cakewalk. An article in the Harvard Business Review (HBR) highlights the challenge of establishing new behaviors: “Acquiring new knowledge and putting it into practice in the workplace entails significant behavioral change—something the skills transfer gap tells us is very hard and costly to accomplish through purely didactic methods, such as lectures, quizzes, and exams.” To dive deep into an example, I met with the Chief People Officer of UiPath, Brigette McInnis-Day. At UiPath, much care is taken to establish key behaviors and to reinforce and measure them. UiPath is a business automation software that enables employee engagement and empowerment. By automating mundane tasks, the software allows people more time to focus on what inspires them. Founded in 2005 in Romania, UiPath operates with approximately 4,000 employees globally. Brigette McInnis-Day, Chief People Officer of UiPath People-First Culture at UiPath UiPath takes a people-first approach, in both its mission and practice. McInnis-Day said, “Our mission and vision is about human achievement. Any company that wants to do that has people at the core, at the heart, and that for me is important from a people-first approach.” McInnis-Day highlighted UiPath’s four core cultural values:   UiPath Has a Culture Team and Group of Culture Champions Devoted to Scaling and Sustaining Its Culture A common thread among great company cultures is that they create unique and inventive approaches to fostering culture. At UiPath, they don’t just lean into being unique, they also back it up with budgets and people. UiPath has a team devoted to culture that serve as the voice of the people. The culture team includes a diverse group of people called culture champions. These culture champions help drive engagement on the ground with the behaviors tied to company values. “Imagine having leaders who receive feedback that's unbiased, outside of human resources (HR).” UiPath Develops Culture by Developing Its First-line Leaders Because research correlates 70% of employee engagement to management, the way a company develops its leaders can be incredibly telling of its culture. At UiPath, McInnis-Day is highly attuned to the value of first-line leaders. “I read an HBR article that stated that first-line leaders touch roughly 80% of the entire population,” she remarked. “That's why first-line leaders are where you need to focus, especially from a people perspective. It's crucial to ensure that they understand how to manage people, how to design processes, and how to handle tough conversations.” McInnis-Day and her team recently introduced a new aspiring leaders program. They’ve also launched a leadership experiences initiative that includes shadowing, job rotations, and various other opportunities beyond just learning. “We are offering learning as well,” McInnis-Day said, “But it's hands-on, interactive, and geared towards applying the skills.” This newly launched initiative is for all leaders at UiPath. Activating Key Leadership Behaviors McInnis-Day was quick to point out that while UiPath’s values are well-chosen, the area on which the company really needed to focus was the behaviors that uphold those values. “To address our values on a behavioral level, we established leadership expectations.” These expectations were based on three questions:   “We've been cascading leadership expectations throughout the organization and measuring it. We took our people's experience survey results last year and focused on three things:   McInnis -Day explained that because clear expectations were set for leaders, UiPath then tied every leader to the OKRs in their direct reports. With such a high degree of transparency and increased communication, the company has seen a substantial increase in key behaviors. McInnis-Day’s Podcast Recommendation for HR Professionals: “Wiser Than Me” with Julia Louis-Dreyfus All of the chief people officers I have interviewed are voracious readers and learners. Asked what podcast she would recommend for HR professionals to listen to, McInnis-Day recommended Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s Wiser Than Me. “The premise is about sharing your background, sharing your journey as a woman, and listening to more senior women who've been there longer with different experiences. If you start to listen to women in their seventies or older and what they have been through in their lives, how they've seen their careers, and what's happening, you can learn a lot about where we need to go. I also think that this podcast is great to link to the people in your life. Are you listening to them? Do you tap into their knowledge at all ages?” What Excites McInnis-Day the Most about the Future of UiPath Moving forward, the number one thing on McInnis-Day’s mind is HR automation. “Imagine a succession plan where all the information on the employees is already there,” McInnis-Day said. “There are talent pools. We have the ability to move people around based on projects or past experiences. Give them the support they need, all via automation, like we do with our onboarding. It's a different world that we have to redefine quickly because employees want choices and have choices, and they're going to want to go where the work is—the best work they can find.” Kevin Kruse is the Founder + CEO of LEADx, scaling and sustaining leadership behaviors with behavioral nudges, micro-learning, and live cohort-based workshops. Kevin is also a New York Times bestselling author of Great Leaders Have No Rules, 15 Secrets Successful People Know About Time Management, and Employee Engagement 2.0.",en

A group of Sri Lanka's major creditors including the United States, Japan and India want to sign a memorandum of understanding with the country around the time of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings later this month in Morocco. China has resisted joining the group but it remains an observer. ""We are aiming to reach an agreement among creditor nations with or without China,"" a senior Japanese finance ministry official told Reuters, stopping short of confirming the report. ""We will do our best but we cannot tell yet if a deal is going to be reached this month. I personally think we can make it in time for IMF's annual meetings this month."" Sri Lanka has defaulted on its debt as terrorism and the coronavirus pandemic dealt a blow to the main industry of tourism for the island country, whose bilateral external debt stood at $11.3 billion as of the end of March 2023.

Organised by rockers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure almost 40 years ago, Live Aid was watched by an estimated 1.5 billion people. ""If this musical encourages just one person to have a positive impact for the better, then it will be a job well done,"" Geldof said in a statement on The Old Vic website. He said he had watched the production develop. ""I'm looking forward to seeing it ... it better not be shit!"" the famously outspoken singer turned campaigner turned entrepreneur added. ""Just For One Day"" written by author John O’Farrell and directed by Luke Sheppard, will run at The Old Vic from January 26 to March 30, 2024. The theatre said the production had the permission from the Band Aid Charitable Trust, which will get 10 per cent from the sale of each ticket. ""For those of us who were around in the ‘80s, Saturday 13 July 1985 I’m sure will be one of those days that is forever etched in our memories,"" Old Vic artistic director Matthew Warchus said. ""We all remember where we watched Live Aid, who we watched it with, and the pure amazement at the feat that was unfolding before our eyes."" The show will feature songs by Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Queen, The Who, Paul McCartney, Elton John, The Boomtown Rats and others who appeared at the concert that was held simultaneously at London's Wembley Stadium and the John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. It came the year after Geldof and Ure called in a choir of pop stars to record the Band Aid single “Do They Know It’s Christmas?” to raise money to help people caught up in the famine spreading in Ethiopia.

The committee is also pushing for the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to investigate Tools for Humanity (TFH) Corp and Tools for Humanity (TFH) Gmbh, companies affiliated with Worldcoin. The 15-member parliamentary committee, formed more than a month ago and tasked to investigate Worldcoin, said in the report submitted to the House last week that the actions of Worldcoin ""constituted acts of espionage and a threat to statehood."" The report also revealed that Worldcoin started collecting data on Kenyan citizens on May 31, 2021, and it only applied for a data controller's license in the country in August 2022, violating the country's Data Protection Act of 2019. ""Worldcoin started collecting data in public places on May 31, 2021, and applied for registration as data controllers in Kenya on August 22, 2022, one year after commencing their activities in Kenya, contrary to the Data Protection Act of 2019,"" the committee said in its findings,according toa local news outlet. Aside from the report, the committee recommended that the DCI start probing Tools for Humanity Corp and Tools for Humanity Gmbh. The National Assembly also censured Information, Communication and the Digital Economy Cabinet Secretary Eliud Owalo for supposedly misleading Kenya on the actual status of Worldcoin in the country. In early August, Kenyasuspendedall activities of the iris biometric cryptocurrency project while government agencies in the country evaluated its potential risk to public safety. A few days later, Kenyan authoritiesraidedthe company's warehouse in Nairobi and seized its machines and documents. The supposed raid was executed after authorities conducted an investigation and discovered that Worldcoin failed to disclose its true intentions when it registered in Kenya, the country's Office of the Data Protection Commissioner Immaculate Kassait said. In late August, Kenyaformedan Ad Hoc committee to investigate Worldcoin. Last month, Kenyan Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki claimed that U.S. authorities blocked the country from detaining Worldcoin Chief Executive Alex Blania and its chief legal counsel Thomas Scott. As of 6:04 a.m. ET on Monday, WLD was trading up at $1.71, with a 24-hour trading volume up by 99.58% at $185,204,592, representing a 0.68% increase in the last 24 hours and a 2.8% gain over the past seven days.

The GPS spoofingreportedlycaused complete navigational system failures in some overflying airliners and business jets over the last two weeks, prompting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue a memo about the route's safety risks. The incidents were first reported by OPSGROUP, a flight data intelligence crowdsourcing website that has pilots, flight dispatchers, schedules and controllers as members. The website said the fake signals sent from the ground overpowered the onboard navigation system of commercial and business aircraft using Airway UMB688 in northern Iraq. The airway is majorly used by flights between Europe and the Middle East. The GPS spoofing led some aircraft to lose navigational capability. One aircraft was led so far astray that it almost strayed into Iranian airspace without clearance, reportedForbes. OPSGROUPsaid it received separate reports about aircraft in the airway experiencing GPS spoofing. In one incident, the crew aboard a Boeing 777 was forced to ask Baghdad Air Traffic Control (ATC), ""What time is it, and where are we?"" ""In Baghdad airspace, we lost both GPS in the aircraft and on both iPads. Further, the IRS didn't work anymore,"" one report read. ""We only realized there was an issue because the autopilot started turning to the left and right, so it was obvious that something was wrong. After a couple of minutes, we got error messages on our FMS regarding GPS, etc. So we had to request radar vectors. We were showing about 80 nm off track. During the event, we nearly entered Iran airspace (OIIX/Tehran FIR) with no clearance."" ""Nearing north of Baghdad something happened where we must have been spoofed. We lost anything related to Nav and the IRS suggested we had drifted by 70-90 miles,"" another report said. The FAA issued amemo, warning aircraft operators about increased ""safety offlight riskto civil aviation operations."" GPS spoofing, which is believed to have led the aircraft astray, is the surreptitious replacement of a true satellite signal with a manipulated signal to misguide flights. The manipulated signal can cause the onboard GPS receiver to provide an incorrect position and time. GPS spoofing is not the same as GPS jamming, in which the GPS receiver can no longer operate. It can be hard to immediately identify GPS spoofing, and if the GPS receiver does not identify the false signal, the aircraft will calculate its position according to the false signals and then redirect it to stray away from the intended route.",en

Passionate about VR.   The landscape of medical education has undergone a radical transformation over the years. We embarked on this journey with pencil sketches and cadaveric material in the anatomical theaters of medical schools, gradually transitioning to digital computer-based interactive aids. With the advent of the digital age, simulations and 3-D models became widely accessible, enabling students to explore virtual anatomical structures in an immersive environment. Many companies, such as Medical Realities, Virtual Medicine and Biodigital, offer virtual medical atlases that present intricate 3-D models of anatomical structures in virtual reality. Students can interact with them to visualize and better comprehend theoretical information from medical books. However, despite these advancements, which presumably should bring education in line with reality, I still see a huge gap between in-class training and clinical practice. Even the highest-quality drawing assets are static images capable of representing only a limited number of cases. This contrasts with the dynamic and unique nature of each human body and its medical condition, which often don't correspond to the ""textbook archetype."" To bridge this educational gap, students can learn from real studies they may encounter in actual practice. As the founder of an IT company focused on augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), I see a significant opportunity to leverage VR to visualize CT and MRI scans, illustrating how pathological conditions can actually appear in practice. Real-world examples of such a solution include HQSoftware's Bodyscope and ImmersiveTouch's ImmersiveView VR. These platforms enable uploading 3-D series of CT, MRI and PET/CT imaging and reconstructing them in volume in virtual reality. Based on my industry experience, I envision three primary ways by which VR solutions can revolutionize medical education. 1. Advanced Radiology Mastery In Educational Institutions Medical students today utilize computer labs for viewing DICOM files, spending most of their time examining studies cross-sectionally. Although this approach mirrors the typical routine of radiologists, it requires sophisticated spatial vision. In my perspective, this method has drawbacks, as any learning experience should primarily be straightforward and easy to understand for trainees. VR offers a transformative alternative, enabling students to observe scans in 3-D, explore slices, change contrasts, label objects and more. This encourages students to take an active role in their learning, enhancing engagement and learning motivation. Notably, a study on the applicability of skills acquired through simulation to real-world practice found that practicing CT skills in VR helps students feel more prepared for actual scanning compared to solely observing DICOM files on computers. 2. Accelerating Residency Training For Junior Radiologists As students transition to residency, they bring theoretical knowledge of radiodiagnosis but often lack specialized insights for independent practice. So, they need to explore a lot of real-world cases, which can be available more conveniently and quickly with VR. 3. Training For Specialists In Allied Surgical Fields Until about a decade ago, hardly anyone was teaching non-radiologists, such as trauma surgeons, how to explore different types of medical images. Although they can be proficient in understanding X-rays, only a few are able to interpret CT and MRI scans. This can limit their ability to see the full clinical presentation, potentially delaying accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions. With VR, specialists can visualize images to explore pathology in detail as well as plan surgeries or other procedures. One study shows that by viewing VR reconstructions of splenic artery aneurysms before endovascular embolization, specialists feel more confident in the consistency of their actions. Ultimately, whether it's advanced radiology mastery, accelerated residency training or enhanced specialist education, VR's role in visualizing MRI and CT scans is reshaping how future healthcare professionals learn and excel. Embracing these advancements isn't just an option but a transformative step toward a more informed, capable and confident medical workforce, benefiting patients and healthcare as a whole.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) Men’sCricket World Cuphas witnessed evolving formats, stiff competition, and tense controversies over nearly five decades. The 13th edition of the tournament, being hosted by two-time winners India, will be held from October 5 to November 19 and will see 10 teams vie for the one-day international (ODI) cricket’s most coveted trophy. Here is a look back at the tournament’s 47-year history. The ICC was founded in 1909, with England, Australia, and South Africa as the only members. The three countries played a Test cricket tournament in 1912, but poor weather conditions in England and a lack of public interest meant the competition did not happen again. Teams around the world continued to play bilaterally until the ODI format gained popularity in the 1960s, following its introduction in English county cricket. The first Cricket World Cup of any kind was a women’s tournament organised in 1973 by the International Women’s Cricket Council, which later merged with the ICC. Hosts:England Winners:West Indies As the only country with enough resources to host the event, England eventually organised the first Men’s Cricket World Cup in 1975 with eight teams in the competition and the ODI format in its fifth year. The six Test-playing nations at the time – Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and the West Indies – were joined by Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa. South Africa, one of the strongest teams in world cricket, were serving a ban from international cricket over the country’s apartheid-era policies. The tournament was played in white kits, with red balls and in a 60-overs-a-side format. The West Indies defeated Australia by 17 runs to win the trophy in the final at Lord’s. Amid the celebrations, which saw fans pour down to the field, a pitch invader stole famous British umpire Dickie Bird’s hat. Hosts:England Winners:West Indies Based on the success of the inaugural competition, the World Cup became a recurring event on the international cricket calendar and was mooted to be held every four years. The competition stayed in England, who made it to the final but lost to the defending champions West Indies by 92 runs. England’s leading bowler Bob Willis missed the final match due to an injury that he suffered in the semifinal. Star West Indies batter Viv Richards was awarded man of the match for his 138 runs from 157 balls. Hosts:England Winners:India Breaking the West Indies’ shot at treble, India’s 1983 World Cup win made them a force to be reckoned with and their captain Kapil Dev a household name in his country. In what is considered an iconic moment in the tournament’s history, Kapil Dev ran backwards to complete a catch that saw Richards dismissed for 33 as India completed a 43-run win. In a famous statement, David Frith, then-editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly, said: “Show me a person who gave Kapil Dev’s team any chance of winning the 1983 World Cup and I will show you a liar and an opportunist.” The Indian team’s 1983 World Cup win became a famous underdogs story and was depicted in the 2021 Bollywood film titled 83. Hosts:India and Pakistan Winners:Australia For the first time, the tournament was held outside England as it switched to a 50-over format to adjust to fewer daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent. After having three tournaments with all-English umpires, this World Cup was the first to feature neutral umpires. Australia and England faced off in one of the closest World Cup finals at the famous Eden Gardens stadium in Kolkata, then known as Calcutta, after defeating co-hosts Pakistan and India in their respective semifinals. Australia beat England by seven runs and David Boon was named player of the match for his 75 runs. Pretournament favourites West Indies did not advance past the group stage. Hosts:Australia and New Zealand Winners:Pakistan As the tournament returned after five years and moved Down Under for the first time, it brought several changes: coloured kits, white balls and day-night matches played under floodlights. It was also the first World Cup to include television replays and the use of a third umpire to adjudicate run-out appeals. With the end of apartheid, South Africa returned to international cricket and were included in the tournament for the first time, increasing the number of teams to nine. They advanced to a memorable semifinal, where a controversial “rain rule” left them needing 22 runs off one ball when play resumed after a rain delay. In a defining moment for Pakistani cricket, Imran Khan led his team of self-styled “cornered tigers” to a 22-run victory over England. Hosts:India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka Winners:Sri Lanka Sri Lanka joined second-time organisers India and Pakistan as co-hosts in the midst of a civil war in the island nation. The tournament was hit by a controversy before it began, as several countries refused to play in Sri Lanka. Australia and West Indies forfeited their matches in Colombo after a bombing at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the capital three weeks before the tournament. The ICC then awarded two points to Sri Lanka, who became the first team to qualify for the quarterfinals. Controversies continued to plague the tournament. An unruly crowd in Kolkota disrupted India’s semifinal against Sri Lanka when the hosts lost their eighth wicket. Meanwhile, Pakistani cricketer Wasim Akram’s house in Lahore was stoned by an angry mob after he pulled out of Pakistan’s quarterfinal against India citing an injury. In the final at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium, Sri Lanka’s Aravinda De Silva and captain Arjuna Ranatunga guided the team home in a chase of 242 against Australia and brought their first World Cup title. Hosts:England Winners:Australia The World Cup returned to England after a 16-year hiatus and was held a year early to avoid a clash with the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. The number of teams increased to 12, with Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Kenya, and Scotland joining the lineup. Pretournament favourites Australia and Pakistan met in the final, which turned out to be a one-sided match after Pakistan were bowled out for 132 runs, setting off Australia’s treble run in the tournament. Hosts:South Africa Winners:Australia The first World Cup to be held on the African continent saw star Indian batter Sachin Tendulkar shine with 673 runs, and Australia play without legendary spinner Shane Warne as he served a ban after testing positive for a prohibited drug. Australia beat India by 125 runs in the final in Johannesburg. Hosts:West Indies Winners:Australia It was a World Cup beset by controversy, tragedy and upsets. Pakistan’s South African coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room a day after his side’s shocking three-wicket loss to Ireland in the group stage. Following Woolmer’s death, organisers imposed restrictions on music and celebrations in the stands. Bangladesh shocked India by beating them by five wickets in the group stage. India and Pakistan failed to progress to the Super Eight stage. Australia continued their golden run in the tournament and bagged their fourth title after beating Sri Lanka by 53 runs. Hosts:India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka Winners:India India became the first team to win the World Cup on home soil after beating Sri Lanka in the final by six wickets in the first all-Asian final. Australia’s 12-year reign came to an end with a quarterfinal loss to India, who went on to beat Pakistan in an enthralling semifinal in Mohali. Pakistan lost hosting rights for the tournament due to security concerns after the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by armed men in Lahore on a 2009 tour. Hosts:Australia and New Zealand Winners:Australia The two host nations faced off at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with Australia eventually emerging as the victors in a one-sided final. New Zealand’s Martin Guptill set a new world record for most runs in an ODI innings scoring 237 runs in the quarterfinal against the West Indies. Hosts:England and Wales Winners:England In one of the greatest ODI matches in the game’s history, the last World Cup ended with a tied final match between England and New Zealand at Lord’s Cricket Ground. The match went into a super over but that too ended in a tie and England were awarded the win based on the boundary countback rule. In other milestones, Australia’s fast bowler Michael Starc claimed the most wickets in a competition with 27 dismissals. The number of competing teams fell to 10.

It is the first time the assembly has been held outside the bloc. Ukraine is not an EU member but wants to join. The meeting comes a day after further military funding for Ukraine was left out of a last-minute US budget deal.  EU policy chief Josep Borrell has described the ongoing war in Ukraine as an ""existential crisis"".  ""Maybe it's not being seen like this for everybody around the world, but for us, Europeans, allow me to repeat it: it's an existential threat,"" Mr Borrell told the gathering on Monday. ""And that's why we have to continue supporting you and discussing with our American allies and friends for them to continue supporting you."" The EU has already announced more than €70bn (£60bn) of military and civilian assistance for Ukraine, which is set to arrive over the next few years.  Mr Borrell has said that ""sustainable and predictable"" is what the bloc is striving for with its military support, and is keen to highlight the fact that support and sanctions continue to be voted through by member states. Meanwhile French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna described Monday's gathering as a ""demonstration of our resolute and lasting support for Ukraine, until it can win"".  ""It is also a message to Russia that it should not count on our weariness. We will be there for a long time to come."" The US budget deal, which is a temporary measure, did not include $6bn (£4.92bn) in military aid for Kyiv. But President Joe Biden, who has already approved some $46bn (£37bn) in military aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion last year, said Kyiv could ""count on"" US support.  The Kremlin says it believed conflict fatigue would grow in both Europe and the US but that Washington would continue to be directly involved in the conflict.  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday that he thought it had been an ""incident"" rather than an example of waning support.  Hardline Republicans in the US oppose further military aid for Ukraine, with many openly opposing President Joe Biden's approach to the war. ""We are now working with both sides of Congress to make sure that it does not (get) repeated again under any circumstances,"" said Mr Kuleba.  ""So we don't feel that the US support has been shattered."" Ukraine has been making some progress in its pushback against Russia - widening the breach in Russia's defences in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.  It has also made advances around Bakhmut after Russia moved some of its most experienced troops from there to strengthen defences further south.  But progress on the ground has been slower than hoped overall and while Ukraine has been able to rely on its military progress in the past as political currency, it is now having to utilise diplomacy more than ever.  Speaking to reporters at the EU meeting, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for a strategy to insulate Ukraine from attacks on the country's power grid, which left millions without heating last winter. ""Ukraine needs a winter protection plan of air defence, generators and a strengthening of the energy supply,"" she said.  But there are cracks appearing within the EU. It's notable that two of the countries known to have the most issues with Ukraine, Poland and Hungary, have not sent their foreign ministers to Kyiv, and are instead being represented at state level. And on the weekend a pro-Russian candidate won the parliamentary elections in Slovakia, an EU member. Robert Fico, who is a former prime minister, is expected to start coalition talks on forming the next government. He has previously pledged an immediate end to military support for Ukraine. Mr Kuleba said it was ""too early to judge"" how the election result would impact his country.  Political developments within the EU - including Slovakia's recent election result, a polarising election campaign in Poland where Ukrainian support is being scrutinised, and Hungary's continued attempts to block Western aid - mean the EU's task of creating total unity within its membership will be far from easy.

Ukraine's allies are concerned that worsening weather as winter approaches will significantly slow the progress of Ukrainian forces as they try to break through Russia's formidable defensive positions. But Gen. Oleksandr Tarnavsky, who is leading Ukraine's counteroffensive on the pivotal front line in south Ukraine, recently told CNN he did not believe it'd be a major factor. ""The weather can be a serious obstacle during advance, but considering how we move forward, mostly without vehicles, I don't think [the weather] will heavily influence the counteroffensive,"" Tarnavsky told the outlet. The comments were made on September 22, and werere-published on October 1in an analysis of Ukraine's looming winter tactics. Tarnavsky said that Ukraine was using small groups of soldiers, operating mostly on foot, during the counteroffensive. In the early weeks of Ukraine's counteroffensive, analysts said that Ukraine was would likely rely on armoured vehicles, many supplied by its Western allies, to break through Russia's ""Surovikin line"" of multi-layered defenses. NATO officials spent weeks training Ukrainian forces to use sophisticated maneuvers involving large units to achieve a breakthrough. But as the offensive dragged on,Ukraine has reverted to more familiar tactics,using precise artillery strikes and small units to make incremental but important gains, most significantly in the Zaporizhzhia region. Tarnavskytold the BBC in July that armored vehicleswere struggling to get through dense minefields and other obstacles. Instead, Ukrainian infantry units were attempting to clear Russian trenches in brutal close combat reminiscent of World War I. A minimum criterion for the success of Ukraine's counteroffensive would be seizing back control of the town of Tokmak, which lies just behind the front line, Tarnavsky told CNN. ""Tokmak is the minimum goal,"" he said. ""The overall objective is to get to our state borders.""",en

The website, royal.uk, went down for over an hour on Sunday morning due to a denial-of-service attack, a tactic for overwhelming a machine or network to make it unavailable, a royal source told ABC News. The source said the website was not hacked because no access was gained to systems or content. It was unclear who was responsible fort the denial-of-service attack, according to the source.  There was no official comment on the matter from Buckingham Palace. A pro-Russia hacktivist group that calls itself Killnet claimed to be behind what it described as an ""attack on paedophiles,"" apparently referring to Britain's Prince Andrew, Duke of York, who was accused of sexually abusing an American woman when she was 17, claims the prince has denied. Killnet has been active since at least 2022, around the time that Russia launched an invasion of neighboring Ukraine. The group has become known for its distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against countries supporting Ukraine in the ongoing war, especially NATO members, according to ananalyst notereleased earlier this year by the Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ""While KillNet's DDoS attacks usually do not cause major damage, they can cause service outages lasting several hours or even days,"" the note states. ""Although KillNet's ties to official Russian government organizations such as the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) or the Russian ForeignIntelligence Service (SVR) are unconfirmed, the group should be considered a threat to government and critical infrastructure organizations including healthcare.""  Sunday's cyberattack came days after Britain's King Charles III voiced support for Ukraine during a speech at the French Senate in Paris. He referred to Russia's ""military aggression"" as ""horrifying."" ""Together, we are unwavering in our determination that Ukraine will triumph and our cherished freedoms will prevail,"" Charles said in his remarks on Sept. 21.

Minister of Social Protection Florence Bore said their closure was aimed at ending child trafficking. She said the children would be placed in family and community care, which offered a better environment for them. A 2017 UN children's agency report estimated that 40,000 children lived in 811 registered institutions in Kenya.  Data on the number of children in unregistered institutions is unavailable. Ms Bore posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the government was already in the process of reforming children's homes and orphanages. ""In the next eight years private homes will not exist. We need to prepare in order to absorb those children,"" she said on Sunday during an inspection of children's care facilities under construction by Kenya's government. Ms Bore has said that the government will, however, continue housing children in facilities managed by the Child Welfare Society of Kenya, the government agency tasked with the care, protection, welfare and adoption of children in Kenya. Kenya has planned to phase out private children's homes and orphanages since the 2022 Children's Act was passed. The law recommended placing children without families in alternative care such as guardianship, foster care placement and adoption to curb the abuse and trafficking of children. There have been widespread concerns about the exploitation of children in Kenya's orphanages and children's homes.  In 2017, a non-governmental organisation, Stahili Foundation, said that some orphanages and children's homes in Kenya convince families to give away their children before using them to solicit donations.",en

Lam received a red card for a dangerous tackle on Japan back row Lappies Labuschagne after 48 minutes of Samoa's 28-22 defeat and accepted his actions had been reckless, according to an Independent Judicial Committee on Monday. The 32-year-old received a 50 per cent reduction of the mid-range six-game sanction, with a further match chalked off if he completes World Rugby’s ‘tackle school’, a coaching intervention programme. He has indicated that he will. The committee noted Lam’s “admission of foul play and correctness of the red card at the first opportunity, an exemplary disciplinary record, apology to the player and good character”. Lam misses the must-win game against England, where Samoa still have the slimmest of hopes of reaching the quarter-finals. They must win by 29 points or more and hope the other fixture in the pool between Japan and Argentina ends in a draw without either of the teams grabbing a try-scoring bonus point.  ",en

Gegham Stepanyan, Nagorno-Karabakh’s human rights ombudsman, said that the bus that drove into Armenia carried 15 passengers with serious illnesses and mobility problems. He issued a call to share information about any other residents who want to leave but have trouble doing so. In a 24-hour military campaign that began on September 19, the Azerbaijani army routed the region’s undermanned and undergunned Armenian forces, forcing them to capitulate, and the separatist authorities agreed to dissolve their government by the year’s end. While Baku has pledged to respect the rights of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, the bulk of them have hastily fled the region, fearing reprisals or losing the freedom to use their language and to practice their religion and cultural customs. The Armenian government said Monday that 100,514 of the region’s estimated 120,000 residents have crossed into Armenia. Armenian Health Minister Anahit Avanesyan said some people had died during a gruelling and slow journey over the single mountain road into Armenia that took 40 hours. Azerbaijani authorities moved quickly to reaffirm control of the region, arresting several former members of its separatist government and encouraging ethnic Azerbaijani residents who fled the area amid a separatist war three decades ago to start moving back. After six years of separatist fighting ended in 1994 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Nagorno-Karabakh came under the control of ethnic Armenian forces, backed by Armenia. In a six-week war in 2020, Azerbaijan took back parts of the region in the south Caucasus Mountains and surrounding territory that Armenian forces had captured earlier. On Sunday, Azerbaijan’s prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for ex-Nagorno-Karabakh leader Arayik Harutyunyan, who led the region before stepping down at the beginning of September. Azerbaijani police arrested one of Harutyunyan’s former prime ministers, Ruben Vardanyan, on Wednesday as he tried to cross into Armenia. The Armenian authorities have accused Russian peacekeepers deployed to Nagorno-Karabakh after the 2020 war of standing idle and failing to stop the Azerbaijani onslaught. The accusations were rejected by Moscow, which argued that its troops didn’t have a mandate to intervene in the fighting. The mutual accusations have further strained the relations between Armenia, and its longtime ally Russia, which has accused the Armenian government of a pro-Western tilt. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan alleged Thursday that the exodus of ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh amounted to “a direct act of ethnic cleansing and depriving people of their motherland.” Azerbaijan’s Foreign Ministry strongly rejected Pashinyan’s accusations, arguing that the departure of Armenians was “their personal and individual decision and has nothing to do with forced relocation.” A United Nations delegation arrived in Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday to monitor the situation. The mission is the organization’s first to the region for three decades, due to the “very complicated and delicate geopolitical situation” there, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters Friday. Local officials dismissed the visit as a formality. Hunan Tadevosyan, spokesperson for Nagorno-Karabakh’s emergency services, said the UN representatives had come too late and the number of civilians left in the regional capital of Stepanakert could be “counted on one hand.” “We walked around the whole city but found no one. There is no general population left,” he said.",en

The foreign ministers of all 27 European Union member states are meeting in war-torn Ukraine in their first-ever meeting outside the bloc’s borders, displaying support for Kyiv. The unannounced meeting takes place as the Ukrainian government pushes to join the EU in the future, amidRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which is in its 20th month. “I am convening today the EU Foreign Ministers in Kyiv, for the first-ever meeting of all 27 Member States outside the EU,” the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a post on social media platform X on Monday. “Ukraine’s future lies within the EU,” he added. Top officials from EU capitals have often visited Kyiv since the beginning of the war, but this is the first time an official EU summit is being held in the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba hailed the ministers’ meeting “within future borders” of the EU in a post on social media platform X. “Glad to welcome EU foreign ministers at the historic meeting in Ukraine,” he said, adding: “For the first time in history, outside current EU borders. But also within its future borders.”      French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said the meeting was a signal to Moscow of the bloc’s determination to support Ukraine over the long term. “It is a demonstration of our resolute and lasting support for Ukraine, until it can win. It is also a message to Russia that it should not count on our weariness. We will be there for a long time to come,” she told reporters in Kyiv. The EU member states, along with the United Kingdom and the United States, have provided massive military and financial support to Ukraine, enabling it to stand up to theRussian offensive. Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from the Ukrainian city of Lubny, said the meeting symbolises a crucial moment in EU-Ukraine relations. “The Russian war in Ukraine is an existential threat not just to Ukraine, but to the European project,” he said. “The majority of EU countries speak in one voice when it comes to supporting Ukraine in this war,” Basravi said. Monday’s meeting comes days after the US Congressblockednew aid for Ukraine in a government spending deal despite calls from the White House in the opposite direction. As uncertainty sets in over how long Kyiv’s allies will keep sending billions of dollars for the war, Kuleba said that Washington’s support for Ukraine was not weakening. “We do not feel that the US support has been shattered … because the United States understands that what is at stake in Ukraine is much bigger than just Ukraine,” he told reporters as he greeted Borrell for the summit. “The decision was taken as it was, but we are now working with both sides of the Congress to make sure that it does not repeat again under any circumstances,” Kuleba added. US President Joe Biden on SundayreassuredKyiv and allies of continued financial support for the war effort despite the US Congress’s decision. He pressed congressional Republicans to back the aid, saying he was “sick and tired” of the political brinkmanship that had nearly closed the government down.           Follow Al Jazeera English:",en

More specifically, I've been enjoying a recurring column called ""Everything Has a History,"" which provides the histories of everything from20-sided dietoelevator soundstoBig Mouth Billy Bass, and much more. The latestentry, written by Sherri Sheu, the Haas Curatorial Fellow at the Science History Institute in Philadelphia and an at-large member of the AHA Council, is about the ""Johnny Horizon Environmental Test Kit,"" a toy for budding environmental scientists manufactured by Parker Brothers in 1971 that capitalized on the growing interest in environmentalism and ecology that was ignited after the first Earth Day in April, 1970. Sheudescribesthe kit: The kit contained 10 experiments for children to test the air and water in their neighborhoods. Youngsters could take samples from their local waterways and culture a petri dish to test for fecal coliform contamination or dip pH strips to test acidity and alkalinity. They could test smoke density in the air or use sticky paper to find and count air particles. In the spirit of the scientific method, the experiments could be repeated multiple times, with refill kits also available for purchase. ""Johnny Horizon""—which Sheu describes as a ""rugged outdoorsman figure""—was a mascot created in 1968 by the Bureau of Land Management to promote environmental education through a series of anti-litter public service announcements through the 1970s. Sheu also explains that while the kits taught real science and provided some sense of agency to youth seeking to address environmental issues in their neighborhoods, the kits focused on individual responsibility—don't litter, avoid pesticides, etc.—and didn't address much in terms of more structural solutions, which, of course, is an ongoing problem: Yet, for all its testing capabilities, the kit could not provide many solutions. In a list of suggestions, the handbook recommended reading more books on the environment and instructed users to refrain from littering, avoid pesticides, reduce plastic use, and travel by mass transit. Only in the last recommendation did the booklet suggest reporting test results to the EPA or local authorities. The kit offered a way to observe the environment, not to solve environmental problems or engage in political action. It is perhaps too much to ask for a solution to wide-scale environmental pollution from a toy. However, the limitations of the Johnny Horizon Environmental Test Kit illuminate a long-standing tension of the environmental age: What can everyday citizens do in light of the need for global systemic change? A half century after the kit's appearance, many of us still feel that we are trying to confront climate change with only children's toys.",en

The voodoo theme and dragon red ground… [+4322 chars]",YouTube,"HP’s long-running Omenbrand—launched in 2016—spans everything from desktops to monitors, but it’s the latest Omen Windows laptop that attracts our attention today. The voodoo theme and “dragon red” ground effects from yesteryear are all but gone now, but what remains is HP’s commitment to using the Omen brand to providetop-shelf gaming performancewhile keeping prices reasonably in check. (If you want even more value, HP’s newer Victus line is designed to trim prices even further, though at the expense of missing out on bleeding-edge components.) Let’s get the obvious out of the way: The new Omen 16 is no featherweight that will slip easily into your messenger bag. With a 16.1-inch (non-touch) display and plenty of power under the hood, the laptop weighs 5.1 pounds and measures 32 millimeters thick, making it one of thebeefiest laptopsI’ve seen in years—both literally and figuratively. Powered by a rare combination of an AMD CPU (a 4-GHz Ryzen 9 7940HS) and an Nvidia GPU (a GeForce RTX 4070), you won’t readily find more raw power in a portable elsewhere on the market today. While these components are backed up by a relatively scant 16 GB of RAM and a smallish 512-GB SSD, those items are at least easier to upgrade if you need more memory. Performance is frankly stellar: There was hardly a benchmark I threw at the Omen 16 in which it didn’t easily trounce the competition, the sole exception being a just-missed-it score on the VRMark Orange Room test, where it barely trailed the high bar set by theHP Envy 16I tested a few months ago. On everything else, the system turned in scores anywhere from 2 to 30 percent higher—and it even shocked me by showing off battery life just shy of 8 hours on a full-screen YouTube playback test. I’ve tested gaming rigs in recent years that were lucky to hit 2 hours of running time—including older Omen models—so that’s a real bonus. While the Omen can chow down on benchmarks, design isn’t its strongest suit. Most curious is the choice of adding a three-column bank of keys to the right of the keyboard, which doesn’t include a numeric keypad. The arrow keys and the various garbage keys like End and Pause appear over here, but the Delete key is relegated to a half-height key above the backspace button. The bigger problem with this design is that HP had to shrink down all the keys on the keyboard to fit everything in, though at first, I thought I was crazy thinking something was amiss. The issue nagged at me, and over time, I found thattouch-typingjust wasn’t going as smoothly as it should, so I measured the keys with digital calipers. Sure enough, the Omen's keys were 0.3 mm narrower in width (about 2 percent) than the keys on two other laptops on my desk at the moment. That may not sound like much, but you’d be surprised what a difference it makes when you’re trying to do sustained typing. It didn’t just feel uncomfortable, I also made more mistakes. On top of this, bizarrely, the space bar juts out toward the touchpad an extra couple of millimeters beyond the rest of the keys. This doesn’t impact productivity, but it sure does look weird. The rest of the machine won’t help it win any design awards with a chunky, all-black design that is seemingly focused on maximizing the use of vents. They’re not just on both sides and the rear of the device, but half the entire underside of the laptop is dominated by a monstrous ventilation grille. And if you miss the days of real-mounted expansion ports, the Omen's has some nostalgia for you here, too. Two USB-C ports and one USB-A port are on the sides of the laptop, but you get an additional USB-A port, an HDMI 2.1 jack, and a full-size Ethernet port on the backside—along with a dedicated power port. The screen—at just a 1920 x 1080-pixel resolution—is surprisingly dim (which perhaps helps out on the battery life front), but the Bang & Olufsen speakers do manage to perform just fine. The fan can get a little rowdy under load, but even under heavy strain, it never gets so loud as to become unbearable. Considering the performance it can put out, any added noise is a fair trade-off. Lastly, pricing is something of a moving target that interested parties will want to follow closely. This unit's MSRP (model number 16-xf003dx) is $1,850 at Best Buy and $1,810 on HP’s website for the same configuration. Best Buy has dipped the price to $1,450 though. I don’t know what the “real” price of this laptop is, but I can say that whatever you do, you should wait for a sale before handing over your cash.",en

All three appointments, which are effective immediately, bring a wealth of financial, strategic and leadership expertise and experience to the Company.

Mr. Ayalon is a highly accomplished senior executive with over 20 years of cross-industrial involvement in global financial advisory and investment, as well as operational management roles within corporates, hedge funds and investment banks.

Accidents in disused mines are common in Zimbabwe, where artisanal or small-scale miners defy authorities by mining in old shafts that are prone to collapse. The latest incident happened in Chegutu, some 100 km (62 miles) west of the capital Harare on Friday. Vice-president Constantino Chiwenga told the local Sunday Mail newspaper 13 had died in the collapse at the site which had not been properly sealed off. Deputy mines minister Polite Kambamura could not say how many people were still trapped underground after the 700 meter-deep mine collapsed. ""The problem is that there was no proper register to ascertain how many people entered,"" Kambamura said. ""We are sending another team to assess the situation. We want to account for everyone."" State broadcaster ZBC on Friday reported that 34 miners were trapped underground out of which 13 had managed to escape. Dozens of distraught family members waited in tents, hoping for news of relatives.  ""The most painful thing for me is not knowing if my son is dead or alive...I can't take it anymore knowing that he is down there,"" said a weeping Memory Gohwe, whose son remain trapped. Some worried relatives already feared the worst. ""To be honest we have lost any hope of getting any survivors,"" said Omega Jonera, nine of whose family members were trapped underground.",en

Only31 shipswill be allowed through the canal per day from November 1, down from circa36 to 38 dailyship crossings during normal operations. The announcement was a further cut from the earlier figure of 32, imposed in August. That restriction caused abacklogof hundreds of vessels waiting to cross the canal. Ships that usually crossed the canal in two-and-a-half days had to wait more than nine to make the journey, Insider previously reported. The situation has become so dire that some shipping firms have paid millions of dollars to buy an earlier place in line. The CEO of the gas-shipping company Avance Gas said during the company's second-quarter earnings call in September that it had put up$2.4 millionto win an auction held by the canal authorities to cut the line. The canal authority reported thattraffic had returned to normalby early September. As of October 2, there were about95 boatswaiting to cross the canal, However, analysts at Project44, a supply chain platform, previously told Insider the upcoming holiday season could add further strain on the popular shipping route. Unlikethe Suez Canal, which relies on seawater, the Panama Canal uses freshwater from an artificial lake to supply its waterway. But after an unusually dry year, the watershed of rivers and brooks that usually feed into the lake has been particularly meager, leaving Lake Gatun with about 80 feet of water. It would usually have about 87. Because of this, the canal authority has had to ration the transit through the Panama Canal locks,per the AP. Ricaurte Vásquez Morales, the administrator of the canal, previously predicted the canal's income could fall by as much as $200 million next year because of the reduced traffic. He told French international news outlet France 24 that the El Niño climate pattern could worsen the situation further. ""We have to find other solutions to remain a relevant route for international trade. If we don't adapt, we are going to die,"" Vásquez told France24.",en

Brian Chesky was interviewed by Bloomberg about how the company plans to use AI to fix some of its issues including its longstanding battle with guests who throw disruptive house parties at rentals despite its firmanti-party stance. ""We've used machine learning techniques to look at the last billion and a half guest arrivals and see which yielded a party and which didn't,"" Chesky told Bloomberg. ""If you try to do this through a human eye, you might not notice any patterns, but AI can look through over a billion data points, find a lot of similarities, and create a rule set."" He explained that if an attempted booking raises concerns ""we either stop them or we ask them for more information, until we either get comfortable with you or we don't get comfortable with you."" Chesky added that AI will also be used to verify whether listing pictures submitted by hosts match up with satellite images in order to help purgefake listingson the platform. The company permanently banned house parties in June 2022 after testing atemporary ban during the pandemicin 2020 saying that some guests ""have chosen to take bar and club behavior to homes, sometimes rented through our platform."" It further introducedreservation screening technologyin December 2022 to prevent some guests from booking out an entire home just for one night unless they have received positive reviews from other hosts. Chesky did not go into particular technical detail of the firm's AI technology, but its use of AI to predict guests' rule-breaking behavior may raise eyebrows. While AI models can predict, for example, crime in particular areaswith some accuracy, researchers have foundthey can also perpetuate racism. The CEO has been optimistic about howAI will change Airbnb,saying at Bloomberg's Technology Summit in June that the platform will soon become the ""ultimate AI concierge"" to help users find the best rentals and experiences suited to them.",en

The groups -- Darwin Climax Coalitions, Sea Shepherd France, Wild Legal and Stop EACOP-Stop Total -- filed their action on September 22,  saying that TotalEnergies ""must no longer continue to knowingly, freely and with impunity fuel climate change"", lawyers William Bourdon and Vincent Brengarth said. ""It is time to hold the company responsible for its activities,"" they said, adding that the court action is unprecedented by seeking a criminal Judgment ""for facts resembling a climaticide, which until now had their place only before civil courts"". The groups say that with its East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), TotalEnergies is liable for charges including destruction, damage or deterioration of property belonging to others likely to create a danger to persons, and failing to deal with a disaster. Human Rights Watch (HRW) in July urged a halt to the project after TotalEnergies and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation last year signed a $10 billion deal to develop Ugandan oilfields and ship crude through a 1,445-kilometre (900-mile) pipeline to Tanzania's Indian Ocean port of Tanga. Rights activists and environmental groups have slammed a deal that has also faced criticism in the European Parliament. TotalEnergies says an estimated 100,000 people displaced by the project have been fairly compensated, and measures have been taken to protect the environment. The project involves drilling around 400 oil wells in Murchison Falls Nature Park, a biodiversity reserve and Uganda's largest national park. The company said Monday that it was unaware of the latest legal action and what it hoped to achieve, telling AFP that it ""conducts operations in accordance with its operating standards and with laws and regulations"". A French civil court earlier this year dismissed on procedural grounds a landmark case against the firm over the project after several NGOs filed a suit seeking to suspend it. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has vowed to proceed, syaing the landlocked poverty-riven country will enjoy an economic boost from the project. In the latest allegations, the associations say the pipeline would entail ""a major impoverishment of local populations"" and severely impact the local environment. French NGO Les Amis de la Terre launched a first judicial broadside against the project in 2019. Saying that the pipeline did not respect the 2015 Paris accord on cutting global carbon emissions, the lawyers in the latest case warned of ""chaos"" resulting from rising temperatures if such projects went ahead. They urged French authorities to ""force TotalEnergies to radically change its investment strategy to drastically reduce fossil investments and massively develop renewable energies"".",en

Spain’s Energy Minister Teresa Ribera has warned that talks at the COP28 climate summit will be “challenging” as she opened a gathering of energy ministers and climate leaders from around the world in Madrid. Spain, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Council, is pushing for an international coalition to back the 2015 Paris deal’s target to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. At the COP28 conference, countries will assess how efforts to tackle climate change are falling short of the Paris Agreement goal and discuss plans to get on track. There are five conditions for the upcoming summit to be considered successful, the International Energy Agency chief, Fatih Birol, said. These include tripling global capital expenditure on renewables, doubling of energy efficiency improvements and an agreement on mechanisms to support clean energy financing in emerging countries. Global coal, oil and natural gas consumption may peak before 2030, he added. More than 20 oil and gas companies had positively answered calls to align around net zero by 2050, to eliminate methane emissions and stop routine flaring by 2030, COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber said at the conference. He did not elaborate. The COP28 summit is scheduled to take place in Dubai from November 30 to December 12. The summit is seen as a crucial opportunity for governments to expedite action to limit global warming with reports so far showing countries are off track to meet promises to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C.

And just as progress on the battlefield is hard won, so too these days are its diplomatic gains.  Since Russia's invasion last year, Western support for Kyiv has remained largely strong. But cracks are beginning to form in the pro-Ukraine alliance.  The United States is Ukraine's greatest supporter by a long way, allocating more than $110bn (£90bn) in military and economic support. Yet over the weekend, Congress ditched plans to give Ukraine another $6bn in a bitter internal battle over how to fund the federal government.  Some Republicans think support for Ukraine should be curbed, others think it should be provided only if President Biden spends more on US border security.  Mr Biden has promised Ukraine another $24bn soon, but that may now be vulnerable to internal US politics.  On the other side of the Atlantic, Ukraine may be about to lose another ally. In Slovakia, elections saw Robert Fico's Smer party win most seats, although he still needs to form a coalition. The populist former prime minister is widely seen as pro-Moscow and anti-Kyiv, having campaigned on a promise to end military support for Ukraine.  ""People in Slovakia have bigger problems than Ukraine,"" he said. That means - alongside Viktor Orban's Hungary - there are now two European Union countries ready to veto further collective EU action to support Ukraine. Neighbouring Poland is also holding elections soon - and there too, doubts about supporting Ukraine have been aired. The ruling Law and Justice Party has promised to halt the import of cheap Ukrainian grain that Polish farmers oppose.  The President, Andrzej Duda, has described Ukraine as a drowning man dragging down his rescuers. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland was ""no longer transferring any weapons to Ukraine"", although this was later reversed.  So electoral politics are beginning to bite into Ukraine's support. So too are other issues, whether the global cost-of-living crisis or the climate emergency.  At the United Nations General Assembly recently, it was noticeable how Ukraine was no longer automatically at the top of the agenda.  President Volodymyr Zelensky's first in-person speeches to the UN assembly and the Security Council did not command the same attention as before. Diplomats noticed the sheen had come off the Ukrainian delegation as leaders from the Global South pressed their own agendas.  All of this is what strategists in the Kremlin have been long been hoping for. Diplomats believe Vladimir Putin wants to wait out the West, keeping the fighting going until Ukraine begins to lose international support and seeks a political settlement.  Western leaders insist they have the stamina to stay the course and show more strategic patience than Russia expects. Not for nothing did the UK Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, tell the House Magazine this weekend that international fatigue with the war was a ""big thing"" and ""something we have got to deal with"", acknowledging it was ""putting pressure on countries all over the world"".  His counter-argument was that if Western support for Ukraine diminished, then those pressures - whether economic or political - would only get worse: ""This is tough and this is painful. But it will only be more tough and more painful if we falter.""  To counter that impression, EU foreign ministers visited Kyiv on Monday, meeting there collectively for the first time in a demonstration of support.  Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, told the BBC that the EU would maintain its military backing, so far worth more than €5bn (£4.3bn). ""One thing is clear: for us Europeans, the war of Russia against Ukraine is an existential threat and we have to react according to that,"" he said. But he admitted he was ""worried"" about Congress's decision to block further aid. The counter-argument diplomats are making is that more than the fate of Ukraine hangs in the balance on the battlefield. They say countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America are beginning to warm to this argument.  Before, some of those countries dismissed the fighting as a European regional war that had little to do with them. But Russia's withdrawal from the Black Sea grain initiative and its attacks on Ukrainian grain silos have made it easier for Ukraine and the West to argue that the Global South has a stake in the fight.  Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told reporters: ""What is at stake in Ukraine is much bigger than just Ukraine. It's about the stability and predictability of the world."" So Ukraine is playing a long game. Key figures within the government have long anticipated that Western support might soften over time. They have been ready for the vagaries of transatlantic electoral cycles.  And they know the real test of Western unity may come later at two key moments. First, if Donald Trump is re-elected President next year and curbs US support, then Ukraine will face a big decision about how long it can continue fighting.  And second, if there is some kind of end to the conflict, then allies may find it hard to unite around the compromises that might be needed to reach a political settlement.",en

The planes will each have six first-class suites, separated by individual doors in a first for the airline. JAL says that this makes the suites more private and eliminates the need for overhead storage compartments. The suites will have a choice of three seating modes: Passengers can keep both seats upright as a sofa, pull them both down to make a 80-inch long double bed, or pull one down to have a seat and a single bed. The suites will have 43-inch TVs, and passengers won't need headphones for the inflight entertainment thanks to speakers built into their headrests, which JAL says is a world first. The headrest also reclines so that passengers can watch and listen to the entertainment even when the seats have been converted into a bed. The suite has a wardrobe, storage space, what itdescribesas a ""personal minibar"" for plastic bottles, and a digital monitor for passengers to speak to flight attendants with. In information about the new cabin interior, JAL describes the first-class suites as like staying in a ""luxury hotel room,"" being at a ""live concert,"" sitting in a ""movie theater,"" and ""relaxing at home."" First-class and business-class passengers will also get an amenity kit, including a toothbrush. The airline says that it had designed the aircraft's interior ""to immerse customers in the elegance of Japanese aesthetics and envelop them in tranquility, providing a serene ambiance that encapsulates the beauty of Japan."" The planes will seat 239 passengers in total across first, business, premium economy, and economy classes. JALsaysit will be launching the new aircraft ""before the end of the year,"" noting that its planned November launch on the Tokyo to New York route was delayed due to supply-chain disruptions. JAL plans to put 13 of the aircraft into service.",en

Subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor and successfully navigate the bitcoin and crypto market rollercoaster ahead of next year's historical bitcoin halving! Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared shortly after publishing bitcoin's white paper in 2008 and the name has since been linked to various coders, developers and so-called cyberpunks—with Australian computer scientist Craig Wright orchestrating an elaborate but unconvincing demonstration that he is Nakamoto in 2016. Now, after Wright has spent years claiming to be Nakamoto and dragging naysayers through the courts, a leaked email has suggested one of his biggest backers has lost faith. Bitcoin's historical halving that's expected to cause crypto price chaos is just around the corner! Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will keep you ahead of the market A bronze statue commemorating the mysterious bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto was unveiled in ... [+] Budapest, Hungary in 2021. Christen Ager-Hanssen, the former nChain chief executive, has quit the bitcoin SV infrastructure company, going on to leak emails suggesting former gambling billionaire Calvin Ayre who has heavily backed the company doesn't believe Wright, nChain's chief scientist, is Satoshi Nakamoto. 10/04 update: An X (Twitter) account calling itself ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" with the handle @Satoshi has posted for the first time since 2018, sparking fresh speculation about bitcoin's creator. ""Bitcoin is a predicate machine. Over the following months, we shall explore different aspects that were not explicitly contained within the white paper,"" the account posted. ""These aspects are all parts of bitcoin, and are important. Some of these ideas were touched upon in the early years; now is the time to extrapolate and explain."" However, X's community notes feature added: ""This isn't the real Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of bitcoin. Its an account related to Craig Wright, who claims to be Satoshi with no material proof."" Ager-Hanssen posted that the ""account has been taken over by Craig [Wright],"" while others have linked it to Andy Rowe, an associate of Wright. Bitcoin SV, which stands for Satoshi's vision, is a fork of the payments-focused bitcoin cash, itself a fork of bitcoin that split from the original bitcoin blockchain following the so-called blocksize war of 2017. ""I can confirm I have departed from nChain Global,"" Ager-Hanssen posted to X (Twitter). ""I have also reported that I have found compelling evidence that Craig Wright has manipulated documents with the aim to deceive the court that he is Satoshi. I’m today myself convinced that Craig Wright is not Satoshi."" Ager-Hanssen followed up his resignation with a leaked email he claims Ayre sent to Wright that appears to show Ayre is poised to pull his support for Wright's various lawsuits, calling it ""shocking evidence."" ""I have been operating under the assumption that you ... have the keys and you were simply pretending not to have them as part of some strategy,"" the leaked email purports to show Ayre writing, referring to the private keys that would prove Wright has access to bitcoin known to be mined by Nakamoto. ""But now we are looking at a situation where continuing to deny you ruin your life and damage your supporters."" Ayre appeared to warn that Wright will lose an upcoming case brought against Wright by the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA), something that ""will set a precedent that you are not Satoshi in law."" In 2021, the COPA filed a U.K. civil suit against Wright, challenging him to prove he authored the bitcoin white paper, with the expected trial date last year pushed out to the beginning of 2024. ""Calvin losing faith in CSW [Craig Stephen Wright] is the only way this thing would ever end,"" Nic Carter, a crypto investor with Castle Island Ventures, posted to X. ""It's incredibly good news that it appears to be happening now. Without his patron, none of his legal harassment of ordinary bitcoin devs and advocates can continue."" Earlier this year, Wright told Forbes his legal strategy will hinge on the movement of the bitcoin codebase to Github and the alleged circumvention of his administrator control. Last month, a U.K. court dismissed Wright's lawsuit alleging crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken had infringed on his copyright by using the name ""bitcoin.""",en

That era ended in the mid-1970s, and since then, Canada has found it hard to build a sustained and productive relationship with India. If Ottawa takes a fresh look at Delhi and begins an engagement rooted in realpolitik, the current crisis in bilateral relations might yet serve a purpose. One thing that puzzles the Indian foreign policy elite about the current crisis is Ottawa’s utter unwillingness to take a political look at the character of the Khalistan militants operating on its soil. External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar’s frequent reference to Canada’s permissive “vote bank politics”, which have become especially acute under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, explains one part of the problem. There is another source of the Canadian establishment’s inability to hear, let alone understand, India’s concerns about the criminal violence of the Khalistani groups operating on its soil. It is Canada’s entrenched culture of self-righteous posturing. The American scholar and columnist Walter Russell Mead, who has written perceptively about the US and the Anglo-Saxon engagement with the world, drew attention to this when he moderated Jaishankar’s talk at the Hudson Institute in Washington last week. Mead recalled the comments by Dean Acheson, US Secretary of State during the early years of the Cold War, on Canada’s tendency to moralise. As the US embarked on a muscular foreign policy aimed at taking charge of the world in the aftermath of the Second World War, it had to endure endless lecturing from its northern neighbour. Discussing international affairs with Canada, Acheson said, was “like listening to the stern daughter of the voice of god”. Acheson was, of course, no American redneck. (The myth of “nice Canadian” versus “boisterous American” endures to this day). He was the son of English migrants from Canada and was quite familiar with its culture. Richard Nixon, struggling to cope with the political turbulence at home and the world at the turn of the 1970s, could not stand the liberal condescension of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau (father of the current Canadian PM). Nixon, in private, called Trudeau a “pompous egghead” and other unprintable expletives. Canada’s moralpolitik had some utility. It helped define a Canadian identity – after all, it is not easy to live in the shadow of the US. It is also quite easy to be “principled” when you are not responsible for anything, let alone running the world. With the luxury of a strong military alliance and expansive economic relationship with the US, Canada could often grandstand on global issues and differentiate itself from Washington. Ottawa, for example, established full diplomatic relations with China in 1970, nearly a decade before the US did. Ottawa also reached out to Cuba with some fanfare in 1976 when Pierre Trudeau visited Havana and met Fidel Castro. Although the trip seemingly defined Canada’s independent foreign policy, it was facilitated by the US decision in 1976 to loosen the embargo on Cuba. The episode, however, is emblematic of an enduring narrative – the US is a “mischief-maker” and Canada is the “helpful fixer”. If the US relies on blunt instruments of military power, Canada would focus on diplomacy and engagement. The US, with its burden of “securing the world from communism and other evils”, had to dirty its hands. Seizing the high moral ground allowed Ottawa to present itself as the “White Knight” of North America. Independent India, it turned out, loved Canada’s moralpolitik becauseDelhiwas in the same mode in the 1950s and 1960s. Delhi and Ottawa were in the same corner preaching the virtues of a normative global order when the great powers were spoiling for a war that could turn nuclear. If the US was taking care of Canadian security interests in the Cold War era, Jawaharlal Nehru believed Delhi faced no threats to its security. That provided a basis for an interesting convergence on global issues in the early Cold War from the Korean War to the Suez Crisis. Nehru and his Canadian counterparts — especially Louis Saint Laurent and Lester Pearson — would call for restraint in global affairs and occasionally help defuse conflicts. Although Canada was a founding member ofNATOand India the leader of the Non-aligned Movement, the two sides found it beneficial to work together. For India, an empathetic Canada was a valuable partner when its relations with the West were under growing strain. Canada could carve out a global niche by acting as a bridge between India and the US and between the West and the developing world. Beyond this, Ottawa’s liberal internationalism saw Canada become a major partner for India. Under the Colombo Plan, Canada offered significant developmental assistance to India. It also empathised with newly independent India’s ambition to develop advanced technology, especially nuclear. Canada helped India build a research nuclear reactor, CIRUS, that would hone India’s skills to produce plutonium that could be used in making nuclear weapons. Canada also joined hands with India to design and develop a heavy-water natural uranium power reactor (CANDU) that would form the foundation for India’s programme for nuclear electric power generation. If nuclear technology outlined the expansive horizons for the India-Canada relationship in a troubled world, it also became the focus of the breakdown in bilateral relations. Canada reacted with ferocious anger to India’s first nuclear test in 1974. India’s moralpolitik claiming it a “peaceful nuclear explosion” did not calm Ottawa’s claim that Delhi betrayed Canada’s support for civilian development of atomic energy. Canada was among the last nations to come to terms with the US effort to end India’s disputes with the global nuclear order during 2005-08. Even as the nuclear contentions peaked and receded, Canada’s minority politics at home began to cast a shadow over bilateral relations since the 1980s. The effort to manage this negative dynamic showed some promise when the conservative Stephen Harper was in power from 2006-15, but began to break down when liberals under Justin Trudeau took charge. In dressing up his domestic political calculus on cultivating Khalistani extremists in the rhetoric about freedom of speech and the rule of law, Trudeau was simply falling back on the time-tested liberal Canadian moralpolitik. The costs of that strategy for Canada’s relations with India – whether Trudeau underestimated them or did not care – are now at hand. But Canada’s India relationship, which holds great economic and strategic potential, is not beyond repair. In the last few days, India has been pointing the way out. Delhi has clarified that the assassination of terrorists abroad is not India’s policy and will cooperate with Ottawa based on credible intelligence-sharing. India, in turn, expects Canada to stop empowering the Khalistani extremists, end the current political impunity they enjoy, and crack down on their violent activities.

The 70,000-seat Olympic Stadium hosts major sporting events throughout the year, including the UEFA Champions league as well as sold-out concerts, most recently Guns N' Roses in the summer. Stadium officials said on Friday all activities would be halted indefinitely after a study found the stadium's roof - as well as that of the country's sole cycling track nearby - ""did not meet the legally permitted levels of static adequacy"". Both venues are housed in the Olympic Athletic Center of Athens (OAKA), Greece's biggest sporting complex spanning 250 acres, which hosted the 2004 Games but has been deteriorating since. Soccer club Panathinaikos has used the stadium for the team's home European games in the 2023-24 season, playing Spain's Villarreal last month. After meeting sports officials, including the Hellenic Olympic Committee on Sunday, Sports Minister Yiannis Vroutsis said the decision to shut the facilities was ""painful"" and efforts were being made to find the best solution for ""where the heart of Greek sports beats"". Vroutsis was expected to announce later on Monday where the games and the activities would be housed in the meantime. Originally built in 1982, the Olympic stadium's famed dome was designed by award-winning Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, who also designed New York's Ground Zero transport hub. The conservative government, which was elected for a second four-year term in July, has faced criticism for the crumbling state of the Olympic complex. It had promised to revamp it in 2021 and had ordered the study into the state of its facilities. In a video on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Stefanos Kasselakis, the recently elected leader of the leftist Syriza opposition, called the dome ""the symbol of a country that is collapsing on all levels; a state that leaves everything and everyone to their fate."" In a news briefing on Monday, government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis defended the state, saying ""The government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, which decided to assess these facilities ... is the one being reproached by the opposition.""

On September 8, France’s top administrative courtupheld a government banon the abaya in public schools. The government had announced the measure in August, claiming it broke the rules of secularism in education. The following Monday, nearly 300 girls showed up to school wearing an abaya; some 67 of them who refused to change were sent home. This ban is part of a series of measures undertaken by the French government in recent years, targeting the Muslim minority under the pretext of protecting secularism – or laïcité. How Muslim women should dress has become a particular obsession of the authorities. In 2004, the country banned the hijab in state schools. Then in 2010, it passed a ban on full-face veils in public. Since 2016, various municipalities have been introducing prohibitions on wearing full-body “burkini” swimsuits in public pools. In November 2022, the then minister of national education, Pap Ndiaye, introduced a Laïcité plan which aims to prevent students from wearing modest – or what is seen as “religiously affiliated” – clothing in French public schools by “strengthening human monitoring”, ie policing them. The plan instructs school staff to go after students wearing long skirts and long-sleeved attire to report them and sanction their behaviour if they refuse to change. Disciplinary action includes halting their education by “prohibiting the student’s access to the [school]” until they understand via dialogue that “their behaviour harms secularism and the values of the Republic”.  France’s commitment to secularism, which it defines as the freedom from religious influence, has clearly been transformed into an ugly cult-like system. The original concept of separating church and state to guarantee freedom of thought and to prevent the coercion of religious dogmatism is no longer the driver of official action. Instead, secularism is instrumentalised to establish complete control over a religious minority and further push them to the margins of society where they hold no social or political power. No other religious group in France is as targeted as the Muslim community. French government officials routinely accuse it of what they call“Islamist separatism”– the idea that Muslims are hostile to the French nation as a whole and do not want to belong to it. In 2021, the government unveiled legislation aimed at combating this “separatism”, by extending the ban on religious symbols, making it easier to close places of worship and coming after Muslim civil organisations. While the French authorities have launched systematic attacks on the whole community, Muslim women and girls have borne the brunt of the French authorities’ obsession with controlling their bodies. It does not matter if the skirt or dress has any religious significance. If the Muslim female body is wearing it, it automatically becomes a danger to French secular values. Tomorrow, if a certain fabric, a T-shirt, or even a certain shoe style gains popularity among Muslim women, France will find a way to ban it. The policing and literally undressing of Muslim women is justified, with the dominant narrative that the Muslim man is forcing the Muslim child and wife to wear Islamic clothing. The image of the helpless Muslim woman or child in need of liberation is one of the driving forces of these policies. That they are actually themselves coercive is, of course, viciously denied. It is not the first time France has tried to control what Muslim women wear. In his 1959 book A Dying Colonialism, anticolonial thinker Franz Fanon emphasised that the control of Muslim women was crucial to the French colonial project in Algeria. He wrote that by forcing Muslim women to unveil, the French were “committed to destroying the people’s originality”. According to Fanon, the French settler authorities “were under instructions to bring about the disintegration at whatever cost, of forms of existence likely to evoke a national reality and to concentrate their efforts on the wearing of the veil, which was looked upon at this juncture as a symbol of the status of the Algerian woman”. Today, the French authorities have transferred their colonial obsession with controlling colonial subjects onto the Muslim community within their own borders. For Muslim girls, this violent experience starts as early as their first encounter with the public sphere – in the classroom. By controlling their right to bodily autonomy from a young age, the French government is attempting to not only silence dissent, but program into the minds of Muslim children that it can give and withhold their freedoms as it pleases. Singling out and targeting Muslim students in schools does not make them more committed to current interpretations of secularism in France. It does, however, traumatise them and further isolates and separates them from the rest of society – ie it does the opposite of “combating separatism”. For example, Collectif Contre l’Islamophobie en Europe (CCIE), a non-profit organisation that documents and fights against discrimination and human rights violations of Muslims in Europe, has highlighted the case of a French schoolgirl, who was harassed by one of her teachers because her skirt was considered to be too long. She told CCIE she was forced to take off her skirt and stay in leggings all day. Worse, school staff associated her choice of clothes with terrorism and with the beheading of French teacher, Samuel Paty, which deeply upset her and made her afraid to go back to school. Unsurprisingly, French government policies and rhetoric attacking the Muslim community are fuelling Islamophobia in the country. In 2022, CCIE reported a total of 501 anti-Muslim incidents compared with 384 in 2021, an increase of more than 30 percent. It has also found that since the implementation of the 2004 law banning the hijab, 59 percent of Islamophobic acts within the education sector were committed against female Muslim students in high school. The CCIE and other  Muslim civil society groups are also trying to challenge the backwardness of the republic and its mistreatment of Muslim women, but they are facing an uphill battle. French Muslim women and girls, for their part, are resisting, despite the constant attacks, policing and harassment. They are constantly reasserting their agency and autonomy and choosing to wear the hijab and traditional Islamic clothing in the face of growing hostility from the French authorities. They know these bans are not about protecting them but about denying them the ability to control their own bodies. Muslim women and girls are not “separatists”, as the state so desperately wants to depict them. They are, however, freedom-seekers, and they will continue fighting for their right to live a life in France free from intimidation and coercion.

Nadya Tolokonnikova, an artist and activist, was placed on Russia’s most wanted list in March. Weeks earlier, she had released an irreverent short film entitled Putin’s Ashes, in which a group of women from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, dressed in lingerie and wearing red balaclavas, press the nuclear button and set alight a 10-foot portrait of the Russian president. “Join our movement against the most dangerous living dictator on the planet,” reads the caption accompanying the three-minute clip. A member of Pussy Riot, the Russian feminist protest art collective formed in 2011, she was reportedly accused by Moscow of “insulting the religious feelings of believers”. She has recently spent much of her time focused on the conflict in Ukraine, raising nearly $7m for Ukrainian war efforts through her cryptocurrency UkraineDAO. She has also curated My Body, My Business at Sotheby’s in support of abortion rights in the United States. Al Jazeera spoke with Tolokonnikova, who currently lives outside of Russia, about her art, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and her views on Moscow’s crackdown on dissent. Al Jazeera: You’ve spent several years in the kind of penal colonies dissidents will now be detained in. What is life like there, in terms of conditions and treatment, and do you think these sites have changed in nature since the war began? Nadya Tolokonnikova:A lot of things have changed since I was in jail, and I was hoping they would change for the better. I’d noticed a few main things to tackle in the Russian prison system: First, we need to get rid of forced labour. We still have this gulag Soviet inheritance of forced labour. Second is the lack of medical treatment – many prisoners die from treatable conditions. And lastly, living conditions. A lot of those facilities have not been updated since the gulag times. A lot of people still live in barracks, in very depressing conditions, often with no access to running water. We would go for weeks sometimes without being able to wash ourselves or our clothes. When I got out of jail, I was hoping that I’d be able to change it. And I did talk to some people who were leaving government offices at the time because it was still 2014, so some people from the opposition were still in government. We were hoping they were going to be able to bring prison reform in Russia. But instead, Russia went back to the new dark ages, starting with the war. It’s the same thing with feminist rights and LGBTQ+ people’s rights. Today, we cannot have any constructive conversations about the rights of prisoners, many of whom are being sent to the warzone to fight for the Russian side. They’re being used as canon meat for the war. Al Jazeera: How do you characterise the state of women’s rights in Russia, and how has the war in Ukraine impacted the struggle for gender equality? Tolokonnikova:With the beginning of the war in Ukraine, it became practically impossible to run a truly independent non-profit. And since our government does not really care about women’s rights, everything [is impacted] – from helping victims of domestic violence, to providing shelters for women, to fighting for our rights in the courts. In Russia, our self-defence law doesn’t work; if a woman killed someone who was threatening her or beating her up, she is sentenced for murder. And the only person who can help her is a human rights lawyer who could argue self-defence. But the government, or judge, or prosecutor, or cops – they don’t let you do that. So really the only people who can help women in Russia are women themselves and the non-profit sector. But the non-profits in this space that were actually legitimate and useful and independent – not just government puppets – were labelled as foreign agents [after the war erupted]. And most of the founders and members of those had to leave Russia because in the last couple of years, even projects that are not directly connected to politics – like helping women or protecting victims of domestic violence. Anna Rivina, the founder of nasiliu.net (No to Violence), Russia’s most prominent anti-domestic violence organisation, [who anticipated the increase in gender-based violence with the onset of the war in Ukraine] was labelled a foreign agent and had to leave Russia. There are numerous cases like this. When you have an extraordinary situation like this, when your country wages war, the conversations around human rights are set back hundreds of years. Nobody talks about feminism anymore or LGBTQ+ rights. There’s no one left in Russia who can talk about it. People are trying to help from the outside. Al Jazeera: What do you think awaits you if you were to return to Russia? Tolokonnikova:I currently have a criminal case opened on me for one of the works I did earlier this year for Putin’s Ashes, a performance that we showed for the first time at Jeffrey Deitch Gallery in LA. They used the Pussy Riot article, which they quite literally created while we were under investigation. They created this article in 2012 about hurting religious feelings. And it’s unclear how I was hurting religious feelings with my art, to me at least. [Editor’s note: Pussy Riot members including Tolokonnikova were charged in 2012 with “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” after performing called Punk Prayer in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, a song which attacked Putin and the Orthodox establishment.] If I go to Russia I’ll be immediately arrested. It was funny at first, and then I realised this comes with a price. The Russian passport is the only one I have, and it basically pretty much makes me a stateless person with few rights in the world. The only country that is supposed to protect my interests and defend my rights is the one which wants me poisoned, dead, or in jail. It does not feel good to be unprotected and stateless and having lots of troubles with travelling. Travel is very important for our job as activists and artists, and that creates complications. Al Jazeera: As an artist – and I know your politics and your art are inextricable – can you talk about how your aesthetic has developed? How have you found your artistic voice? Tolokonnikova:Contrasts are always very important for me. When we were coming up with the name Pussy Riot, we combined something traditionally seen as welcoming, cozy, nice, cute, sometimes even weak – that’s how people see it for some reason – with riot, which is the opposite of it. Contrasts are part of the Pussy Riot look, too. We have bold masks on our faces – they are purple, pink or neon. Yet at the same time, they’re not threatening, they’re still colourful so we signify we came with peace, not war or violence. And we wore very feminine dresses, which is not our everyday attire. When you’re running away from cops, it’s much easier to do it in pants rather than a bright colourful dress, but we decided to use it on purpose to show that femininity can be strong and bold, and riotous and rebellious, contrary to what a lot of people still believe. Al Jazeera: I see that contrast in your recent Putin’s Ashes work – the soft, plush frames combined with splattered blood, or traces of violence… Tolokonnikova:If you see Putin’s Ashes, it features women in practically lingerie. It’s important for me to state the fact that a woman can look how she wants to look. But it doesn’t take away anything from what she has to say. I think across the world really, conservatives are trying to push women into wearing something specific to be taken seriously. Al Jazeera: Can artistic production help people suffering within authoritarian regimes? Tolokonnikova:I think it can help on the emotional level. In my work, I try to combine my art with direct activism that influences people’s wellbeing, like helping prisoners or raising money for Ukraine, and making sure that I help someone in a very constructive and pragmatic manner. Art has a much more subtle influence on things, but it doesn’t mean that it’s less needed. A lot of us are talking specifically about Russian people and Russians who do not support Putin. A lot of us have this open wound after the war started. And we don’t really know how to talk about it, because obviously, our suffering cannot be compared to the suffering of Ukrainians. We still feel that wound and we cannot talk about it because it’s almost unethical. [Through my art, I’m trying to give a voice to], or at least acknowledge, the feelings of those people in Russia who feel unrepresented and silenced. If they decide to stay in Russia they cannot talk anymore, otherwise they’ll just end up in jail for dozens of years or be killed. Or maybe they’re outside of Russia, but they find they have a hard time talking about their feelings because, you know, who wants to hear about our feelings right now? Al Jazeera: How would you characterise Pussy Riot’s place within the history of political art of the past century? Tolokonnikova:Growing up, I really loved the Russian avant-garde movement – though that’s a very imperial phrase since many of its members were actually from Belarus or Ukraine. We have to come up with so many new terms. Russia has such a long way to go in decolonising itself, its history, its language. It’s pretty insane, and we’re just at the beginning of it. Anyway, I was really into [artists] like [Kazimir] Malevich, [Vladimir] Tatlin, [Vladimir] Mayakovsky. All of whom were men – they had women among them who were not that known at the time, unless they were lovers or wives. But then later feminist histories revealed that there were a lot of women in that movement. I always loved the avant-garde’s utopian vision for the world. Our godmothers are Valie Export, Judy Chicago, Marina Abramovic and Cindy Sherman. Guerrilla Girls, Riot grrrl, Jenny Holzer, Martha Rosler, Tracey Emin. We stand on the shoulders of these giants. Al Jazeera: And what do you think is next for you? Tolokonnikova:Well, I guess I’m hoping to not get poisoned or killed. Yeah.

After nine days of fear and panic, the exodus of Armenians is over with the Lachin Corridor that links Karabakh to Armenia all but deserted except for a rare car, said AFP reporters there on a visit organised by Azerbaijani authorities. On a hill, the Armenian flag flew next to a group of civilian volunteers waiting for the last refugees to arrive. In the middle of a bridge between them and an Azerbaijani checkpoint, sat an armoured car belonging to Russian peacekeepers deployed there as part of a peace deal after the 2020 war that Armenia lost. A clapped-out old Russian 4X4 puffed up to the Azerbaijani customs, with a mattress, furniture and a bike strapped to its roof. Its driver, Sergei Astsarian, showed his ID to the Azerbaijanis, who are equipped with the latest digital technology. The 40-year-old shopkeeper said he finally decided to leave his home in the rebel capital of Stepanakert, which gave up its 30-year separatist struggle after a lightning offensive by Azerbaijani troops. In the past few days, Astsarian said he had been living in the city ""alone, like the last of the Mohicans"" and was concerned that he might get stuck there forever. Despite appeals by Azerbaijan for ethnic Armenians to stay in Karabakh, Astsarian said he left because there had been no ""concrete guarantees"", just ""verbal"" ones. ""I spoke to the police and they said: 'You can stay'. I said: 'To do what?'"" ""But if we want to come back, they said: 'No problem, you can live in your homes. And for those of you who have been living in Azeri homes, there will be new ones built.'"". Tens of thousands of ethnic Azeris fled Karabakh during a war in the 1990s and many now dream of returning. Astsarian said he hoped to join relatives living in Europe. After a quick inspection, the car crept forward to go under a huge X-ray scanner, before Astsarian drove on towards the Armenian flag, without looking back. But further up the road taken by the more than 100,000 refugees who have fled to Armenia in just over a week there were eerie remains of the exodus. Strewn on the side of the road were everything from a pink pram to an elegant hat, to a bathtub and a burnt-out Lada -- objects abandoned by ethnic Armenians from Karabakh on their flight. There were several Russian checkpoints on the road that winds through the valley and no Azerbaijani soldiers could be seen -- only Azerbaijan's internal security forces. In Lissagorsk, a yellow minibus laden with luggage could be seen stopped under a Russian flag at one of the checkpoints. On board were around 15 elderly men looking out at a foggy road through dirty windows. They declined to say where they were from. There has been very little information filtering through from the rebel capital Stepanakert, known as Khankendi in Azeri, whose population of 55,000 has mostly left after the separatists' surrender last month. The city is still inaccessible to the media for ""security reasons"". For the first time in 30 years, a UN mission visited the enclave on Sunday to assess the humanitarian needs there. White trucks belonging to the International Committee of the Red Cross, among the few humanitarian agencies able to access the enclave, could be seen on the Lachin road. The Red Cross is engaged in ""life-saving activities"" such as transporting the wounded and bringing medical supplies, the organisation's operations manager Carlos Morazzani said in Geneva on Friday. He said they were also working on transporting the corpses of civilians and soldiers killed in the fighting last month following a ""large influx of bodies"".",en

The idea is that even a shopper who’s not familiar with PC specs can see the “Chromebook Plus” label on a product and be assured that Google thinks it’s a good product. Chromebook Plus devices must have: An Intel Core (i3 or higher) or AMD Ryzen 7000 CPU An IPS panel with at least 1080p resolution A 1080p webcam 8GB of RAM 128GB of storage There’s an interesting absence here: battery life. In fact, the phrase “battery life” does not appear once in Google’s press release. Curious! I asked Google spokesperson Peter Du about this, and he provided the following statement: “All Chromebooks are required to meet a 10 hours battery life requirement based on internal testing standards. While not a new requirement for Chromebook Plus like the 1080p screen or 8GB of RAM, Chromebook Plus laptops must also adhere to this.” I mean, I suppose. I’d love to know what these internal testing standards are. Regardless, Chromebooks are generally thought of as portable devices, battery life contributes heavily to a product’s viability as an on-the-go driver, and I have to wonder why it wasn’t any sort of priority here. This is the Asus Chromebook Plus CM34 Flip. Chromebooks that receive the Plus certification will have access to a few exclusive AI-powered features, some (but not most) of which were demo’ed at a press event last week. These include a magic eraser tool in Google Photos (which can automatically remove background elements), improvements to lighting and noise cancelation in video conferencing, and Offline File Sync (which automatically downloads files from Drive onto your device — something I’d be nervous about, considering the sheer volume I have stored on Drive). More fancy things are on the way, including AI-generated wallpapers that you can create with text prompts and “a personal writing assistant,” which sounds incredibly entertaining. Chromebook Plus products also come with a three-month subscription to Photoshop on the Web and three months of GeForce Now’s priority tier. (RIP Stadia.) You can tweak your video call settings on the bottom right — here’s me doing it in Zoom. Some of the first devices to be announced include: Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming ChromeBook Plus 16 : A gaming Chromebook with an RGB keyboard and a 120Hz screen. EMEA only, £599. Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook Plus 14: 2-in-1 convertible aimed at on-the-go creators. Available now, $499. Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3i Chromebook Plus 14: Lightweight (3.31 pounds) clamshell with military-grade durability certification. Available now, $549.99. HP Chromebook Plus x360 14 and Chromebook Plus 15.6 : “Designed for unrestrained productivity and creativity”, incorporating PCR and ocean-bound plastic. Coming October 8th, $749.99 and $599.99 respectively. Acer Chromebook Plus 515 and 514 : Budget options with both Intel Core and AMD Ryzen options. Coming in October, $399.99.

Now the tech giant is here with Chromebook Plus touting a new hardware standard and a few software tweaks the company promises will be a step up for anybody looking for a simple setup, though still invariably tied to Google’s software brand. Just how “plus” is Plus? Well, Google is making some additions by porting over a few software touches that have become mainstays on Android phones. The Chromebook is getting the Material You redesign, which means users should be able to set pleasing color swatches for their UI based on their wallpapers. Google is also adding its AI-based photo editing tool Magic Eraser to the Google Photos app. There are a few extra quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to set camera background blur, improved lighting, and live captions from the bottom app shelf. The new “Plus” moniker means these Chromebooks promise minimum specs you receive for at least $399. Each comes with an Intel Core i3 12th Gen or AMD Ryzen 3 7000 CPU, or better. Further, a Plus model should have more than 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. Google promised that each will sport a 1080p webcam with temporal noise reduction and a full-HD IPS or better display. Those updated specs should be able to support editing apps like LumaFusion and Google Photos’ movie maker. There are a few nifty features that are singularly geared to Chromebooks. There’s a new dynamic wallpaper setting for Chromebook-specific wallpapers that changes depending on the time of day. Perhaps the most important new feature for legacy Chromebook users is File Sync. Even with a new standard of 128 GB of storage, Chromebooks will still rely on cloud storage for most of their work, meaning it can be a pain when you take your 5G-lacking laptop somewhere without an easy internet connection. After users enable it, File Sync automatically downloads Google Workspace files when it finds an internet connection. Unfortunately, some of the more interesting features of Chromebook Plus will be coming down the road. Google touted several new AI capabilities, including an in-built writing assistant that should work whether in Chrome or Docs. Google is also adding a Generative Wallpaper setting that uses an AI image generator to create a new background based on a prompt. Google offers eight different templates for the AI to base the image, and users will also be able to create AI-generated backgrounds on Google Meet. In the meantime, Google is trying to entice users onto their laptop brand by promising a three-month free trial for Adobe’s new web-based version of Photoshop as well as three months of Nvidia Geforce Now priority tier. Even with Photoshop’s new AI integration through the Firefly image generator, three months is hardly an incentive for each service, especially because after the trial it would cost $21 a month for a somewhat more limited version of Photoshop while Geforce Now will still cost $10 a month. Hell, it was just a few years ago when Chromebooks were advertising three months of the now-defunct Google Stadia.  Older Chromebook models should also receive some of the Material You UI improvements in an updating rolling out to users Monday. Still, older Chromebook models won’t get all the new additions like dynamic wallpapers or file sync. Google said that some older Chromebooks that meet the minimum specs should be able to get the Plus OS feature set.  There are new Chromebook models from regular OEMs including Acer, Asus, HP, and Lenovo to start. There are regular laptop models as well as 2-in-1 flippable models from Asus, HP, and Lenovo with a small variety of specs between them. Lenovo’s slate includes a “gaming Chromebook” model that’s mostly designed around game streaming with a 120 Hz refresh rate, though that model won’t be available in the U.S. to start. There’s a lot of subtle variations between each model. For instance, the $750 HP Chromebook Plus x360 sports a 14-inch flippable screen, while the $600 HP Chromebook Plus has a 15.6-inch display. Meanwhile, Acer’s initial Chromebook Plus 515 with a 12th-gen Intel Core processor sports a 15.6-inch full-HD display (you can pay more for the touchscreen version) while the 514 includes an AMD Ryzen 5 7520 processor and a 14-inch WUXGA screen starting at $449. All these new Chromebooks will be available on Oct. 8 in the U.S. through most major retailers. They will be available in Canada and Europe starting Oct. 9. Those varied prices are just another reminder that, despite the few additional features and guaranteed minimum specs, the Chromebook still has to compete with other cheap laptops that aren’t limited to what Google packs inside ChromeOS. Last month, Microsoft announced the latest in its Surface laptop series, including the $799 Surface Laptop Go 3. It’s up to each user whether they’re willing to spend a little more on a device that runs a full version of Windows 11 or go for a cheaper, though more technically limited laptop. It’s interesting that Google is bringing up its Chromium-based laptop brand while it is currently in the middle of a major antitrust lawsuit alleging Google has used its dominant position to emphasize its software ahead of its competitors. Everything on Chromebook remains tied to Google’s brand of software. The only way to access most features is through Google Chrome and any new apps need to come through Play Store. ",en

What you need to know Over the past few months, we've been hearing rumblings about Google potentially launching a new branding for Chromebooks. Today, Google announced said branding, as there will be an all-new lineup of 'Chromebook Plus' devices.  One of the current problems with trying to figure out which of the best Chromebooks you should buy is that there are simply so many to choose from. Instead of trying to figure out what combination of specs you might need, anything branded with the Chromebook Plus moniker is equipped with a minimum of these specs: This, along with the recent extension of AUE dates for Chromebooks, aims to provide reliable and sustainable devices for years to come. Along with the minimum specs for anything branded as a ""Chromebook Plus"" device, Google says pricing will start at $399 and these devices will include some unique features. With the requirement of at least a 1080p webcam, video calls on your Chromebook are getting a boost from the software. While you're on a call, you can pull up some controls from the shelf, including toggles to ""Improve lighting,"" enable ""Noise cancellation,"" or ""Live caption.""   If you have a mess behind you or simply want to conceal your surroundings, there are also three settings to adjust the background blur. And Google understands that not everyone uses or relies on Meet, so it's confirmed that these tools will work ""no matter what video conferencing app you use."" The fun doesn't stop there, as Google is also trying to make Chromebooks viable for anyone who wants to edit pictures with ease. For one, the excellent Magic Eraser feature is coming to the Google Photos app on Chromebook Plus laptops.   While there are a bunch of great options within the Google Photos app, there are times when you need a bit more control. That's where Adobe's announcement of Photoshop on the web comes in. The company has been working on a web client for the Photoshop app, and it's finally here. With it, not only are many of the most-used features and tools available, but Adobe is also bringing its generative AI feature to the web.  Previously, this was only available for those using the full Photoshop app on either macOS or Windows, but that's no longer the case. As a bonus, Adobe and Google include ""three months of Adobe Photoshop on the web and Express free, when you purchase a new Chromebook Plus."" Additionally, more of Google's AI efforts are officially making their way to ChromeOS, as the company is also including a ""no-cost trial"" of ""Duet AI in Google Workspace."" This is Google's way of flexing its AI muscles in conjunction with apps you use every day, such as Gmail, Docs, Meet, and more.  There are more features in the works for those who pick up one of the Chromebook Plus laptops. Unsurprisingly, it's all about ""generative AI,"" with the ability to ""draft and refine shorter-form content across websites."" Google is also hoping to make it possible to generate ""custom wallpapers using easy templatized text prompts."" If you're interested in picking up a Chromebook Plus laptop, you don't have much longer to wait. Acer, ASUS, HP, and Lenovo will all begin selling different options beginning on October 8, with pricing starting at just $399. We're sure you have plenty of questions about whether these features will come to the best Chromebooks that are already available. Thankfully, that does seem to be the case, as there's a landing page in the Chromebook Help Center that reveals all of the Chromebooks that are eligible. According to Google, the Chromebook Plus OS update ""will begin to roll out on October 17, 2023.""",en

A visionary who ditched the Wall Street track to chart his own course. A philanthropist building a fortune which, he repeatedly said, he intended to give away entirely. This week, he will stand trial in what federal prosecutors have called one of the biggest frauds in US history. The 31-year-old Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, has pleadednot guiltyto seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the collapse of FTX, his crypto-trading platform. If convicted and sentenced to the maximum punishment, he could spend the rest of his life in prison. Here are the key things to know about the case, and what we might see over the next several weeks at the trial. SBF faces seven counts, including wire fraud and securities fraud. Prosecutors alleged that SBF stole billions of dollars from FTX customer funds for his own personal use and to cover huge losses incurred by Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund he also controlled. They also say SBF defrauded investors in FTX by covering up the scheme. Prosecutorsopted in June to sever five other chargesthat were brought after Bankman-Fried’s extradition from the Bahamas, where FTX was based. A separate trial is scheduled to begin on those charges in March. FTX marketed itself as an easy, safe portal into cryptocurrency trading. It made money by collecting fees on customers’ trades, much like a typical brokerage. As digital asset valuations shot up in 2021, so did FTX’s profile. At its peak, the company fetched a private valuation of more than $30 billion. It plastered its name across a Miami basketball arena and won celebrity endorsements fromTom Brady and Larry David, both of whom starred in Super Bowl ads for FTX. But cryptomarket turmoil took rootin the spring of 2022, gutting the entire industry’s value down to $1 trillion from $3 trillion. By November, cracks in FTX’s foundation were beginning to show, and it took just over a week for it all to come crashing down. Investors and customers began to panic in response toa report from crypto news site Coindeskthat raised serious questions about the financial links between FTX and Alameda, two ostensibly separate businesses founded by Bankman-Fried. Based on a document obtained by Coindesk, it appeared that much of Alameda’s assets consisted of FTT, a digital token created by FTX that was rapidly losing value, putting Alameda on shaky financial footing. Customers rushed to withdraw their funds from FTX, exposing an $8 billion shortfall. FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, and Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO. He was arrested in December in the Bahamas on charges including fraud and conspiracy and extradited to the United States in January. Since his arrest, SBF hasrepeatedlyspoken and written about his view of the case: He was an inexperienced businessman who got out over his skis, and he never knowingly committed fraud. His lawyers have hinted in court documents that they will invoke an “advice of counsel” defense. In other words, SBF didn’t know that his actions were illegal and he was following guidance from FTX’s lawyers. In personal writings by Bankman-Fried published by the New York Times, he put the blame for Alameda’s losses on its CEO,Caroline Ellison, who is also his ex-girlfriend. Ellison, along with three other formerhigh-level associates, has pleaded guilty in cooperation with prosecutors. Former FTX executive Ryan Salame will forfeit $1.5 billion after pleading guilty to criminal charges “SBF’s biggest challenge is going to be that his former colleagues are going to testify against him,” said Howard Fischer, a partner with Moses Singer and a former senior trial lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission. On top of that, FTX’s new management, led by a restructuring expert who oversaw the liquidation of Enron, have been openly hostile toward Bankman-Fried. “This kind of cooperation is a godsend for the prosecution,” said Fischer. Another issue, Fischer said, is that SBF, in his long-winded blog posts, tweet threads, TV media appearances and alleged document leaks, “has consistently failed to demonstrate an awareness of how serious his situation is.” “Juries tend not to like know-it-alls who lack respect for the process … While a defendant in a case like this is well advised not to take the stand, it is possible that SBF’s apparently unwavering self-confidence will lead him to take that risk.” Jury selection begins on Tuesday, October 3, in Manhattan federal court. The trial is expected to last up to six weeks. During that timeSBF will remainin the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he has been since Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked his bail on August 11 over SBF’s efforts to intimidate witnesses. If he’s found guilty of all seven criminal counts and is given the maximum sentence, SBF would face the prospect of 110 years in prison.",en

President Bola Tinubu gave a televised address to the nation, saying:“On this solemn yet hopeful day, let us commend our founding fathers and mothers. Without them, there would be no modern Nigeria.” “The journey ahead will not be navigated by fear or hatred. We can only achieve our better Nigeria through courage, compassion and commitment as one indivisible unit,”the president added. Britain controlled Nigeria from the mid-19th Century until October 1, 1960, when colonial rule was brought to an end with a UK Act of Parliament. Independence celebrations in Nigeria typically begin with the president’s morning address, followed by an official parade in the capital, with music, dancing, and a military procession. However, this year’s event was called off due to a severe economic crisis, with strikes and months-long protests triggered by the removal of a fuel subsidy. Speaking on Monday, Nigerian Senator George Akume, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), said that despite the challenges, Nigeria needs to maintain its unity. “We are all agreed, as Nigerians, to live in a united, peaceful and prosperous country. As one people, one destiny in spite of our diversity this is very critical. Without this interest no nation can move forward,”Akume said. ",en

It's easy to see what each thing does and how it does it."" Russia has regularly bombarded Ukrainian targets, both military and civilian, with loitering munitions such as the Iranian-made Shahed-136. It also ramped up production this fall, and a massive future expansion of its drone attacks is predicted,as Insider's Jake Epstein reported. That's a particular concern into the winter, where Russia will likely be hoping to take out Ukrainian energy networks in a repeat of the winter of 2022. Ukraine regularly intercepts large numbers of drones with the help of Western air-defense systems, but it's an expensive activity that arguably favors Russia. It can cost millions of dollarsto take out a drone that cost between $20-30,000, draining Ukraine's resources even when it stops a strike. The US-supplied NASAM missile system, sent to Ukraine last winter,costs around $500,000 to fire. ""Sometimes those missiles cost millions,"" Ukraine's ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko said, per ABC. ""And you hit the drones, which cost $20,000, right? And it's all about the cost."" The Slinger could cut that price tag dramatically. According to ABC, the cost of shooting down a drone with it is estimated to be between $100 and $1,000. EOS is also developing a laser-based anti-drone system, named Titanis, which in a recent demonstration took out quadcopter drones at a distance of more than 3,000 feet,Australian Defense Magazine reported.",en

Ukraine and Russia have both extensively used drones to target each other's forces in the conflict.

Ben Wallace, who recently stepped down from his position,wrote an op-ed about the war in The Sunday Telegraph newspaper. Wallace, an ardent backer of Ukraine, called for more Western support and made the case that Russia is losing. As well as the departure of many military leaders, he gave steep figures for Russian losses in the fighting. ""This war can be won. Vladimir Putin is failing. Just as the human emotion drives Ukraine to success, it is also the inescapable flaw in Putin and his criminal regime,"" wrote Wallace ""Romance, ego and revenge drove Putin to cross into Ukraine and it will be his undoing. His army has lost more than 2,500 tanks, 6,500 armoured vehicles and nearly 300,000 dead or injured. Not a single commander who led the major Russian units into Ukraine is still in place."" Wallace didn't go into detail on the commanders to have changed place, or which Russian units he considered ""major."" Moves in the upper circles of the Russian military can be difficult to follow, with reports abounding of senior officers being punished or stripped of power behind closed doors. Wallace said that Ukraine was succeeding in its counteroffensive.In recent weeks, Ukraine has made incrementalbut important gains in seeking to break through Russian defensive positions in south and east Ukraine. ""Slowly but surely, the Ukrainian armed forces are breaking through the Russian lines,"" Wallace wrote. ""Ukraine has the momentum and is pressing forward."" Russia initially seemed to expect Ukraine to collapse in a matter of days or weeks. But the war is now in its 19th month, with Russia holding around a fifth of Ukrainian territory. The Kremlin has fired or demoted a steady stream of generals since the invasion, with theThe Washington Post reporting last yearthat nine had lost their jobs as the Kremlin sought to shift the blame for failings on the front line. June's rebellion by the Wagner mercenary group saw another wave of reprisals, including of Sergey Surovikin, credited with masterminding Russia's defensive strategy.",en

Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recognized as crucial regulators of numerous biological processes, our knowledge of lncRNAs associated with wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain development remains minimal.Seed Biologypublished an online paper entitled ""A comprehensive atlas of long non-coding RNAs provides insight into grain development in wheat"" on 4 September 2023.To elucidate the landscape of lncRNAs inwheat, the study conducted genome-wide strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq) on grain endosperm at 10 and 15 days after pollination (DAP) and integrated 545 publicly available transcriptome datasets from various developmental stages and tissues. The analysis pipeline was adapted from a previous study with modifications, processed RNA-seq data in three primary steps: mapping, assembly, and filtering.The results identified 20,893 lncRNAs in wheat. The characterization of these lncRNAs indicated an average transcript length of 900 bp, and were predominantly single exon structure (48%), with significant overlap with long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTRs, 41.40%).Compared withprotein-coding genes(PCGs), wheat lncRNAs exhibit shorter transcript lengths, fewer exons, and higher tissue-specific expression than PCGs, and their expression patterns were positively correlated with adjacent PCGs. Furthermore, analyzing the distribution of lncRNAs across the three wheat subgenomes (A, B, and D) revealed that 90.7% of the lncRNAs were exclusive to a single subgenome, suggesting that lncRNAs have different evolutionary trajectories compared with PCGs.To ensure efficient access to this wealth data, this study developed the comprehensive database wLNCdb (http://wheat.cau.edu.cn/wLNCdb), which providesvarious toolsto explore wheat lncRNA profiles, including expression patterns, co-expression networks, functional annotations, andsingle nucleotide polymorphismsamong wheat accessions.Notably, using wLNCdb, the authors identified the lncRNA TraesLNC1D26001.1, which negatively regulates seed germination as its overexpression delayed wheatseed germinationby upregulating Abscisic acid-insensitive 5 (TaABI5). Moreover, this lncRNA appears to co-express with genes associated with starch and protein biosynthesis in wheat, emphasizing its potential regulatory role in grain development and end-use quality.In summation, this pioneering study provides a comprehensive map of wheat lncRNAs. The wLNCdb, with its plethora of information and advanced toolset, lays the groundwork for future exploration and analysis of the functions of lncRNAs.This research not only deepens our understanding of wheat lncRNAs' roles, especially during seed development, but also paves the way for leveraging this knowledge to boost wheat yields and quality in the future.",en

Health Minister Ong Ye Kung gave this update on Monday (Oct 2) at the opening of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Integrated Care Hub's rehabilitation and recovery wards. He previously announced thatthe ministry aims to add 1,300 beds this yearto address the bed crunch at hospitals. This capacity is equivalent to one-and-a-half regional hospitals, he noted on Monday. ""We are on track to open the rest of the additional capacity by the end of this year,"" Mr Ong said. ""This additional capacity requires more manpower, and MOH will continue to closely monitor both the infrastructure development and manpower inflows to ensure that they are increasing in tandem."" Mr Ong said it has been a challenging period for the healthcare community since the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that demand for healthcare will increase with an ageing population. The Health Ministry said in April that themedian waiting time for admission to wardshad risen from about five hours to 7.2 hours.

Mapimpi was ruled out of the remainder of the tournament with a facial fracture sustained in the 49-18 victory over Tonga on Sunday that took the Springboks to the brink of a quarter-final place. Am is a key creative player for the side but was suffering with a knee injury when the squad was announced on Aug. 8. Head coach Jacques Nienaber said at the time Am could be called on at a later stage should they need a replacement. He is the second medical switch for the Boks after hooker Malcolm Marx was ruled out with a knee problem, allowing Handre Pollard to return to the squad. He played his first minutes against Tonga. Jesse Kriel was the only specialist outside centre in the squad prior to Am’s return, though young Canan Moodie has been covering the number 13 and 14 jerseys at the tournament. South Africa will earn a quarter-final place unless Scotland beat Ireland by 21 points or more and the latter get a bonus point for four tries when the teams meet in Paris on Saturday.

This event honors Saint Helena’s discovery of the True Cross in 4th-century Palestine, the cross believed to have been used in the crucifixion of Jesus. Legend holds that the smoke from a ceremonial bonfire guided Helena to this sacred relic, with a fragment of it eventually believed to have made its way to Ethiopia. The central ceremony unfolded before the country’s main church, drawing orthodox leaders, diplomats, and government officials. The festivities culminated with thousands gathering around a bonfire, a symbolic act believed to cleanse them of sins. Notably, the Christian Meskel festival coincided with the Muslim celebration of Mawlid this year, marking the birth of the Prophet Mohammed. In Ethiopia, there is a tradition of mutual respect, with Christians and Muslims, who comprise significant parts of the population, acknowledging each other’s special occasions. Speaking to RT on Sunday, Ahmed Zekaria, a Muslim cleric, said the African country could be a“good example of tolerance when it comes to living together of these different religions.”He highlighted how mosques and churches“live side by side,” adding that it’s a “good sign” that different faiths are “coming to reconciliation and having a peaceful future.""

In April, the government in Pretoria lifted a state of emergency it had declared in February to deal with Eskom’s daily rolling power cuts.On Saturday, Luzipo reportedly said the public hearings in Limpopo province had provided the committee with a better understanding of the people’s frustrations and concerns regarding the bill.While some residents believe the creation of Eskom’s proposed new competitors will stabilize the electricity sector, others are concerned about skyrocketing electricity prices once the new players enter the market.

The ambassador stated that“Poland was among the first to receive an invitation”to the event but ultimately chose to turn it down. Nevertheless, Zvarych said that the Ukrainian side“respects such decisions” by Warsaw and stressed that there is no reason to blame Kiev for Poland’s absence. The International Defense Industries forum took place in Kiev last Friday, attracting company representatives from the US, the UK, Germany, Türkiye, Sweden, and the Czech Republic. The Ukrainian government announced that the event resulted in the signing of 20 agreements, encompassing matters such as drone fabrication, armored vehicle repair and manufacturing, as well as ammunition production. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky also announced that an“alliance of defense industries”was created during the event, which he described as a large-scale international coalition for producing weapons and military equipment. Zelensky noted that this venture will be financed through the sale of confiscated Russian assets. Warsaw refused to attend the event amid a continued deterioration of Polish-Ukrainian relations. That’s after Poland, along with Slovakia and Hungary, unilaterally extended an embargo on Ukrainian grain last month to prevent it from“flooding”and destabilizing the agricultural market. Kiev, in turn, called the import ban“illegal”and filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the three EU states. Additionally, despite Poland being one of Ukraine’s staunchest supporters throughout the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev, Vladimir Zelensky accused Polish officials of“playing out solidarity in a political theater.”He suggested Warsaw’s grain ban was“helping”Russia. In turn, Polish President Andrzej Duda described Kiev as“a drowning man”who risks dragging those trying to rescue him under the water.",en

The government suspended the project in early August following privacy objections over its scanning of users' irises in exchange for a digital ID to create a new ""identity and financial network"". Worldcoin was rolled out in various countries around the world by Tools for Humanity, a company co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. It has also come under scrutiny in Britain, Germany and France. The project still has a virtual presence in Kenya and can be accessed via the Internet, even after the August suspension. The regulatory Communications Authority of Kenya should ""disable the virtual platforms of Tools for Humanity Corp and Tools for Humanity GmbH Germany (Worldcoin) including blacklisting the IP addresses of related websites,"" the ad hoc panel of 18 lawmakers said in a report. It also called for the suspension of the companies' ""physical presence in Kenya until there is a legal framework for regulation of virtual assets and virtual services providers"". Worldcoin's press office said it had ""not seen anything official announced by the Committee directly."" The panel's report will be tabled at the National Assembly for consideration and adoption at a later date. During the suspension of data collection in August, authorities said the project's method of obtaining consumer consent in return for a monetary award of just over US$50 at the time bordered on inducement. Registering to use the platform involved long lines of people queuing to get their irises scanned. The parliamentary panel's investigation found that Worldcoin may have scanned the eyes of minors as there was no age-verification mechanism during the exercise, its report said. The panel also asked government ministries to develop regulations for crypto assets and firms that provide crypto services and called on the police to investigate Tools for Humanity and take any necessary legal action.",en

Neither one even came close, really. Back in March, such a monumental flop by the Mets and Yankees would've been difficult to envision. After combining for 200 regular-season wins in 2022, both clubs were coming off playoff appearances and both added big-name talent in the offseason. With stars like Aaron Judge and Justin Verlander on each side of town — not to mention the two largest payrolls in the majors — the highly anticipated 2023 campaign shaped up as one of the most exciting in the city's history. Maybe another Subway Series. Certainly some October thrills. But by August, all anyone in the Big Apple was talking about wasfootball, as both tattered, top-heavy teams played out the string in front of empty seats. Following parallel nightmare seasons, they headed home early for the winter to watch the playoffs on television. What in the name of Nelson Rockefeller happened here? The $275 million Bronx Bombers batted .227 — only lowly Oakland was worse — and ranked 25th in runs despite replacing hitting coach Dillon Lawson with Sean Casey at the All-Star break. They finished fourth in the AL East at 82-80, narrowly avoiding the franchise's first losing season since 1992. “It’s better than the alternative, but we expect to be playing baseball this month,"" manager Aaron Boone said Sunday. Pete Alonso and the Mets, with a $355 million roster on opening day that was by far the most expensive in big league history, came in fourth in the NL East, nearly 30 games behind division champion Atlanta. After winning 101 games last year, second-most in team annals, they fell to 74-87 by losing their 2023 finale — the largest drop-off in the majors this year. Manager Buck Showalter was fired Sunday, clearing the way for new president of baseball operations David Stearns to pick the next Mets skipper. Stearns was set to be introduced Monday at a Citi Field news conference. “When things aren’t going well in New York, things happen and they happen quickly,” center fielder Brandon Nimmo said. “It’s just our job as players to try and not let these things happen.” Injuries played a damaging role, no doubt. Mets closer Edwin Díaz missed the entire season after blowing out his knee while celebrating a victory withPuerto Ricoin the World Baseball Classic. That exposed an otherwise thin bullpen, while the back of a remade rotation collapsed under a pile of walks as Carlos Carrasco, David Peterson and Tylor Megill were unable to pick up the slack when Verlander, Max Scherzer and José Quintana were sidelined at various times early in the year. All-Star right fielder Starling Marte, meanwhile, was a shell of himself following double groin surgery last offseason and played only 86 unproductive games. Up in the Bronx, $162 million newcomer Carlos Rodón didn't make his Yankees debut until July 7 because of forearm and back issues. Once he did, he never found his form on the mound and went a miserable 3-8 with a 6.85 ERA in 14 starts. A slew of other veterans also drastically underperformed during injury-interrupted seasons, including first baseman Anthony Rizzo, designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton, center fielder Harrison Bader, third baseman Josh Donaldson, catcher Jose Trevino and pitchers Luis Severino and Nestor Cortes. Domingo Germán threw a perfect game in late June, then entered inpatient treatment for alcohol abuse in early August. Of course, the most glaring injury was to Judge, who tore a ligament in his right big toe when he crashed into the outfield fence while making a terrific catch June 3 at Dodger Stadium. The following day, the Yankees moved a season-high 11 games over .500. They were 54-48 and still smack in the middle of the wild-card chase when the reigning AL MVP returned to the lineup July 28, only to go 8-20 in their next 28 games while essentially falling out of the race. The Yankees wasted an outstanding season from ace Gerrit Cole, the frontrunner for the AL Cy Young Award, and reliable relief from one of baseball's best bullpens. “We can talk about injuries, we can talk about missed opportunities, but I think it comes down to us as players not showing up when we needed to,"" Judge said. Similarly, the Mets were 30-27 on June 1 after a three-game sweep of defending NL champion Philadelphia and appeared poised to go on a run with Verlander and Max Scherzer both healthy on the mound. But they dropped their next seven games and 19 of 25 during the June swoon that wrecked their season. Seven games under .500 after losing 3-1 to Rodón on July 26 at Yankee Stadium, the Mets shifted their focus to the future and executed a stunning selloff in the days before the Aug. 1 trade deadline. They parted with Scherzer, Verlander and four other useful veterans in deals to obtain minor league prospects that restocked the farm system. To facilitate the trades, Mets owner Steve Cohen agreed to pay $79 million to the clubs acquiring his former players. And if Verlander exercises his 2025 option, the Mets would send Houston another $17.5 million. The lost season was a stark reminder that money can buy players — but not wins on the field. And while a 162-game schedule offers plenty of chances to rebound and take off, sometimes you only get about 100 to prove you're any good. So in the end, the Mets squandered excellent performances all year from Alonso, Nimmo, shortstop Francisco Lindor and rookie pitcher Kodai Senga. When he returned to Citi Field with the Texas Rangers in late August, a mystified Scherzer was asked how on earth the Mets unraveled so badly? “That’s a billion-dollar question,"" he said. Now what? ___ NEW YORK YANKEES After setting an American League record with 62 home runs in 2022, Judge became a free agent but stayed with the Yankees when they signed him to a $360 million, nine-year contract. He had 37 homers, 75 RBIs and a 1.019 OPS in 106 games this season. Now, the captain needs more help. A lot more. The Yankees must find a way to get younger and less injury-prone — no easy task — while adding legitimate protection for Judge in the lineup. Free agent third baseman Matt Chapman could be a fit. Prized prospect Jasson Domínguez provided an encouraging spark with four homers and a .980 OPS in eight major league games after getting called up Sept. 1, but the 20-year-old center fielder then had Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow that's expected to sideline him until at least July. With Domínguez down for now, the Yankees must decide if they want to pursue a multiyear contract with a high-profile free agent outfielder like Cody Bellinger. Judge is a vocal Boone supporter, and general manager Brian Cashman seems likely to return after signing a four-year contract last December. Judge said he spoke with owner Hal Steinbrenner and Cashman, the team's GM since 1998, about the status of the team moving forward and looks forward to talking with them more this offseason. “We’re not there,"" Boone said. ""That’s the reality of it, and we have to dive in and correct it.” NEW YORK METS Alonso (46 homers, 118 RBIs) can become a free agent following the 2024 season and the Mets might make a critical choice this winter — trade him for future assets or sign him to a long-term contract. Stearns did a terrific job unearthing quality pitching when he was running the Milwaukee Brewers, and he takes on a similar challenge with the Mets. Blake Snell, Aaron Nola and Jordan Montgomery are among the attractive starting pitchers set to hit the free-agent market after the World Series. Both teams in New York figure to be interested in Shohei Ohtani, although the two-way superstar isn't expected to pitch in 2024 following elbow surgery. The Mets have a group of promising prospects who ended the season at Double-A Binghamton. Rookie hitters Francisco Álvarez, Brett Baty, Mark Vientos and Ronny Mauricio all flashed impressive raw power in the majors this year, but none of them had an on-base percentage higher than .296, and defense remains a question mark across the board. ___ AP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum, AP Sports Writer Dave Skretta in Kansas City, Missouri, and freelance writer Jerry Beach contributed to this report. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",en

The Maldives has a population of half a million people scattered across more than 1,000 islands. But last weekend, the picturesque archipelago delivered an electoral verdict that has sent shock waves around the world — and especially across the Indian Ocean region. Mohamed Muizzu, the opposition candidate, emerged victorious in the presidential run-off on Saturday andsecured54 percent of the vote, results released by the electoral commission showed. Muizzu, who backs closer ties between the Maldives and China, defeated the incumbent President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who is widely perceived as pro-India. “With today’s result, we have got the opportunity to build the country’s future,” Muizzu said in a statement after his victory. “The strength to ensure the freedom of Maldives.” The vote transformed into a de facto referendum over the country’s ties with India and China. India has 75 military personnel stationed in the Maldives. New Delhi says they are there to maintain and operate two helicopters and an aircraft it donated to the country. Throughout his election campaign, Muizzu pledged to remove those troops from the Maldives. “Seen from the zero-sum lens that often drives great power competition, Beijing is a big winner from this election,” Michael Kugelman, South Asia director at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think-tank, told Al Jazeera. “Muizzu’s campaign plank was not only about strengthening ties with Beijing, it was also about aiming to undermine India by calling for an end to any Indian military presence in Maldives. This is music to the ears of Beijing,” he added. To be sure, India will look to retain as much of its influence in the Maldives as it can, say analysts. Following the announcement of Muizzu’s victory, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his congratulations to the president-elect. “India remains committed to strengthening the time-tested India-Maldives bilateral relationship and enhancing our overall cooperation in the Indian Ocean Region,” Modi said on X, formerly known as Twitter.      New Delhi has enjoyed cosy ties with Male under President Solih, who took office following a landslide victory in 2018 against Muizzu’s mentor, former President Abdulla Yameen. India poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the tourist hot spot. New Delhi also financed infrastructure projects, both big and small, in the country. “India will support the new democratically elected government and will seek to work closely with it,” Shantanu Roy-Chaudhury, author of The China Factor: Beijing’s Expanding Engagement in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, told Al Jazeera. The Modi government, he said, is “likely to continue its pursuit of the Greater Male Connectivity Projects” — a 6.7km (4-mile) road project currently under construction that aims to link the capital, Male, with the island of Villingili. India has given the Maldives a $100m grant and a $400m line of credit for the infrastructure initiative. But the road ahead won’t be easy for New Delhi, said Roy-Chaudhury. “Given the new government’s pro-China outlook, the future of Indian influence and development projects hangs in the balance,” he said. Muizzu, a 45-year-old civil engineer by training, has taken aim at the imbalanced trade relationship between the Maldives and India, promising to fix it. But while trade between the South Asian neighbours is heavily skewed towards India — as is often the case between a giant economy and a smaller one — the Maldives fares little better when it comes to China. India’s exports to the Maldives amounted to$416m in 2021, while it imported $49m from the smaller nation. China, meanwhile, exported goods worth$395mto the Maldives, and its imports were valued at $3.9m. Muizzu emerged as an unexpected candidate to lead the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM), after serving as the construction minister in the administration of Yameen. A path to the country’s top seat opened up for him after Yameen, also a pro-China leader, was put behind bars on corruption charges. Under Yameen, the Maldives obtained more than $1bn in loans from China to finance huge infrastructure projects, including housing for residents of land-scarce Male and a first-of-its-kind bridge connecting the congested capital to nearby suburb and airport islands.      Analysts say the change of guard in Male could present an opportunity for not just Beijing but also Chinese investors. “Beijing will certainly try to move in, though I wouldn’t overstate the impact of the election on its investment patterns,” Kugelman said. “Even in the era of Solih, who was pro-India but not hostile to China, we saw some continued Chinese commercial collaborations with the Maldives – not on the level we saw during the Yameen era, but still substantive activity. Certainly, though, Muizzi’s victory will be empowering, for Chinese investors as well as Chinese grand strategists and diplomats.” Kugelman said the election results might be a “body blow” to India, both diplomatically and geopolitically, but New Delhi will not throw in the towel. “By no means is New Delhi planning to raise the red flag and effectively cede the Maldives to China. That would fly in the face of its intense competition with Beijing,” he said. “New Delhi will remain confident it can continue to have some degree of partnership with Male.” As Muizzu prepares to take office on November 17, Roy-Chaudhury said the new leader of the Maldives might not be able to abandon New Delhi completely and pivot towards Beijing even if he wanted to. India, he said, would continue to emphasise its developmental aid and seek to build on it. “India and the Maldives both need each other.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:",en

He wasshot and killed Sunday by one of two teenage boys he was confrontingin a restaurant. He published videos of his exploits to over 11,000 followerson Facebookand over 45,000 followerson Instagram.Some of those videos appear to show him engaging in violent confrontations with alleged predators. Lee confronted two teenagers Friday night – a 17- and 18-year-old – at a restaurant in Pontiac. He accused one of being a pedophile and punched him, according to the police news release. The teen who was punched pulled out a knife, and the other – suspected to be the 17-year-old – shot Lee several times with a pistol, according to police. He was taken to the hospital and later died of his injuries. The reporting on Lee generally describes him as a vigilante and his targets as sexual predators, pedophiles and so on, but there is not much about the important context: the rise of YouTuber types who engineer and film violent public confrontions for clout. Their entrapment methodology lures targets but makes them hard to prosecute—and informs the real deal that they have an op-sec problem. CNN notes that Lee has uncovered criminals,including a sheriff's deputy(fired, but not yet prosecuted), but has mistakenly identified people as sexual predators in the past.   ",en

The threat of more Ukrainian counteroffensives in the annexed regions, which include Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, have made Russian officials reluctant to take jobs there, two sources close to the Kremlin toldindependent outlet Meduza. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed adecreelast September formally annexing the four Ukrainian regions, with plans to bring them closer to Russia and pay their employees double, per the outlet. But higher pay does not make up for the risk of Ukrainian attacks, the two unnamed officials told Meduza. Since late last year, Ukraine has retaken parts of eastern Ukraine. An unspecified number of Russian officials, including Alexei Katerinichev, a Russian-installed official in Kherson, have also been killed, per the outlet. At the same time, an unnamed Russian-installed official appointed to a ministerial role in one of the occupied regions told the outlet that leaving a position there for Russia is considered ""desertion,"" which ispunishable by up to 10 years in prison. To make up for the personnel shortages, the Kremlin is holding electoral contests modeled on the ""Leaders of Russia"" competition, which is seen as a career springboard for Russian officials, Meduza reported, without giving details on the number of participants. Russia's Defense Ministry alsoannounced last monththat people in the four occupied regions will be included for the first time in its conscription campaign. The draft, which started on October 1 and lasts through the end of the year, aims to call up 130,000 additional soldiers, according to Russian state media outletTASS.",en

A decade later, living under the protection of UN peacekeepers, Dr Mukwege has launched another challenge against the nation's leadership. He will be running for president in elections due in December, he announced on Monday. Warning: This article contains details some readers may find upsetting Known as ""Dr Miracle"", the 68-year-old rose to global fame for performing reconstructive surgery on women who had been raped in the country's war-torn east. His hospital has so far treated more than 50,000 survivors of sexual violence, while he has cemented himself as one of the world's foremost experts in his field. Dr Mukwege was born in 1955 in Bukavu, a city in eastern DR Congo. After numerous visits to see sick members of the community with his preacher father, he decided he wanted to become a doctor. He began his training at a medical school across the border in Burundi, later studying gynaecology and obstetrics at the University of Angers in France. In 1998, he set up a clinic in his home city. The doctor intended Panzi hospital to be for maternal health, with his team treating new or expecting mothers. However, when war broke out, more and more women came to the clinic with gruesome injuries from sexual violence committed by various armed groups. In 2013, Dr Mukwege told the BBC that rape in eastern DR Congo was part of a ""strategy"" to force communities away from their land and resources. For three decades the region has been wracked by conflict, with numerous armed groups battling for gold and other valuable resources. Different militias have been accused of carrying out indiscriminate rape -  tens of thousands of women are thought to have been attacked over the course of the conflict, Amnesty International has reported. Mr Mukwege told the BBC about his first experience of treating a woman who had been raped and mutilated by armed men. ""After being raped, bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs,"" Dr Mukwege said of the first rape survivor that came to his clinic. ""The real shock came three months later. Forty-five women came to us with the same story.""  Along with his colleagues, Dr Mukwege has since treated tens of thousands of victims and become ""the world's leading specialist in the treatment of wartime sexual violence"", according to the Nobel Prize. Panzi hospital now cares for more than 3,500 women a year. Along with medical treatment, survivors of sexual violence can also access psychological and legal help.  In 2012, in a speech at the UN, Dr Mukwege criticised then-President Joseph Kabila's government and other countries for not doing enough to stop what he called ""an unjust war that has used violence against women and rape as a strategy of war"". The following month he was targeted by gunmen who broke into his home and briefly held his daughters hostage. According to his organisation's website, his trusted friend and security guard was killed during the attack. He later fled with his family to Sweden, then to Belgium. Following a campaign by local women who raised funds to pay for his ticket, he returned home after a year. ""After that gesture, I couldn't really say no. And also, I am myself determined to help fight these atrocities, this violence,"" he told the BBC. Since returning to DR Congo, Dr Mukwege has lived at his hospital, under the permanent protection of UN peacekeepers. He has received the UN Human Rights Prize, been named among TIME magazine's 100 most influential people and bagged the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018. Dr Mukwege told the Nobel committee he was in the operating theatre when the news of the prize came through. Crowds gathered at the hospital, cheering and ululating to celebrate. Although he is new to politics, Dr Mukwege has often advocated on the world stage for peace in DR Congo. Just last year, he called for United Nations sanctions against Rwanda for its alleged support of the M23 rebel movement in eastern DR Congo, whose resurgence has led to bloody clashes and displaced hundreds of thousands. Rwanda denies the accusations. But despite his track record, Dr Mukwege lacks the nationwide political networks that some of the other presidential candidates enjoy. Analysts have therefore questioned the doctor's ability to disrupt the status quo, calling him a ""stranger"". However, he is celebrated in DR Congo as a prominent gynaecologist and philanthropist who has a sense of local politics. The idea of running for president came from him supporters, who contributed money, albeit a modest 160 million Congolese francs ($64,000; £53,000), which won't go far in a country the size of Western Europe.. The trailblazing doctor will be hoping his reputation and humanitarian acts sway the country's voters, who are desperate for good governance after more than a century of exploitation by a succession of rulers dating back to colonial times.

""Such a shelter will allow thousands of children to continue their in-person education safely even during missile threats,"" he said. Rocket attacks hit the Kharkiv region again on Monday - a regular occurrence. Ukraine says more than 360 educational facilities have been destroyed and over 3,000 damaged since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. According to the UN children agency Unicef, only a third of Ukraine's schoolchildren currently study in-person, amid continuing deadly Russian missile and drone attacks as well as shelling. Many of those pupils have been forced to attend classes in underground metro stations and other makeshift shelters - often without proper heating. Last week, the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency said many schools in the 27-member bloc were struggling to integrate children who have fled the war in Ukraine.  It said there were currently about 1.3 million Ukrainian children in the EU. In Sunday's post on social media, the Kharkiv mayor announced that ""it is here that we plan to build the first underground school in Ukraine"". Mr Terekhov said the school ""will meet the most modern requirements for defensive buildings"". And he stressed that the city authorities ""will not reduce educational expenditure by a single hryvnia [Ukraine's currency] this year or next year, despite the lack of budget funds"". The mayor gave no details on when the underground school would open, and how many pupils would be able to study there. Last month, more than 1,000 Kharkiv pupils started their new school year at five underground stations that were turned into the so-called ""metro-schools"". The students are ferried by buses, and study in two shifts: the early one starts at 09:00 local time, followed by the late one at 13:00. Police and rescuers are on duty at each underground station. ""Lessons in the metro. Could you ever imagine that Ukrainian children will study in the underground? This is our reality now,"" Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said at the time. Kharkiv - Ukraine's second-largest city located only 30km (19 miles) from the Russian border - was heavily bombed during the first weeks of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion launched in February 2022.

The Norwegian leading high-tech company Hystar AS specializing in green hydrogen production, has announced its ambitious venture—a state-of-the-art 4 gigawatts fully automated electrolyser factory in Norway, while planning towards international expansion into North America to benefit from investment incentives in the region. Water electrolysis is one of the most promising alternatives to store energy from renewable energy resources, considered as most promising techniques for high pure efficient hydrogen production from renewable energy sources. The news comes as Hyster CEO Fredrik Mowill and his colleagues Leila Asdal Danielsen, Magnus Thomassen and Tina Andersen participate in the Hydrogen America Summit in Washington D.C from October 2nd. “Our Høvik GW factory demonstrates our commitment to rapidly expanding our European operations and meeting the strong demand for our technology across Europe. As we continue to scale up our operations, we are now looking at opportunities beyond Europe - the North American market has created a highly favourable environment for companies like ours to thrive in (...),” said Mowill. The Norwegian tech company said it still has to identify the exact location for its future North American headquarter facility as ""both the US and Canada have attractive incentives on offer”"". Last week the International Energy Agency (IEA) released its Global Hydrogen Review , highlighting the rising costs and a lack of government support as significant barriers to the widespread commercialization of green hydrogen, crucial for decarbonizing heavily polluting, hard-to-abate industries such as steel and ammonia. Hystar started in 2019 as a spin-off from Norwegian SINTEF, one of Europe’s largest independent research organizations. Its existing 50 MW facility located in Norway has already commenced production of its electrolyser stacks for its upcoming deliveries. Among its clients, both energy company Equinor and fertilizer giant Yara will receive a total of 1 megawatt by the end of 2023. In 2024, the facility will deliver 5 megawatt Poland’s largest private energy company Polenergia. The new Norwegian facility is set to be delivered by 2025, while the multi-GW factory in North America will be completed by 2027.",en

""Together we were able to accomplish what many said was impossible only six months ago. We would not have been able to achieve this industry-changing contract without WGA Chief Negotiator Ellen Stutzman, Negotiating Committee co-chairs Chris Keyser and David A. Goodman, the entire WGA Negotiating Committee, strike captains, lot coordinators, and the staff that supported every part of the negotiation and strike,"" Stiehm continued. The AMPTP also released a statement congratulating the membership on accepting the agreement.  ""The AMPTP member companies congratulate the WGA on the ratification of its new contract, which represents meaningful gains and protections for writers. It is important progress for our industry that writers are back to work."" According to the WGAW and the Writers Guild of America East, ""99% of WGA members voted to ratify the contract."" The exact breakdown of the votes were 8,435 ""yes"" votes and 90 ""no"" votes. The agreement covers Sept. 25, 2023 through May 1, 2026. In the organization’s statement Monday, the WGA encouraged the AMPTP to negotiate a deal with SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors. ""Now it’s time for the AMPTP to put the rest of the town back to work by negotiating a fair contract with our SAG-AFTRA siblings, who have supported writers throughout our negotiations,"" WGAE President Lisa Takeuchi Cullen said in a statement. ""Until the studios make a deal that addresses the needs of performers, WGA members will be on the picket lines, walking side-by-side with SAG-AFTRA in solidarity."" Hollywood writers began voting last Monday to ratify a tentativecontractwith the major TV and movie studios. The agreement the week beforeendeda nearly 150-day strike after top union brass gave writers the go-ahead to return to work before finalizing the contract. Late-night talk shows, such as ABC's""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""and NBC's ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,"" have already returned to the airwaves. Thetentative dealis set to shape employment in the industry on issues ranging from increases in pay to the use of artificial intelligence and the sharing of viewership data. The negotiating committee for the writers' unionlaudedthe tentative contract as ""exceptional, promising, meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of the membership,” late last month. The tentative agreement wasconfirmed in late Septemberby The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, or AMPTP, the group negotiating on behalf of the studios. Disney, one of the studios represented by AMPTP, is the parent company of ABC News. The contract dispute followed a decade-long shift to streaming that has dramatically changed the way audiences watch TV and movies. In turn, writerssoughtnot only pay increases for their immediate work but also alterations to residual payments, which is the compensation writers receive when their shows or movies are re-aired or gain popularity. Under the tentative contract, minimum weekly pay for writers will increase more than 12% over the three-year duration of the deal, according to asummaryof the tentative agreement made public by the WGA. Moreover, various projects will see a major boost in residual payments. A feature-length project made for streaming with a significant budget will receive a 26% increase in the residual base made available to writers.   Alongside these pay increases comes a first-of-its-kind agreement forcing the studios to share the audience data for original streaming programs, which will allow the writers to understand how much their shows are being watched. Because a non-disclosure agreement governs this stipulation, however, the data may not be made available to the public. Another key focus for writers throughout negotiations centered on the potential use ofartificial intelligenceas a substitute for their work. Under the terms of the tentative deal, AI cannot write or rewrite scripts, the WGA summary previously said. Meanwhile, a writer can choose to use AI if a studio approves of its use, but a writer cannot be required to do so. The agreement does not prohibit studios from training AI on writers' work. Since July, a union representing roughly 160,000 actors – SAG-AFTRA -- has been out onstrikeas they seek a new contract of their own, bringing Tinseltown to a halt. The two professions had different demands in some key areas. The actors, for instance, have faced strong opposition from the studios over a demand that they receive 2% of the total revenue generated by streaming shows. -ABC News' Jason Nathanson and Matthew Fuhrman contributed to this report.",en

More than 20oil and gas producers, from both the private and state sectors, have made the commitment alongside setting targets to reach net zero by 2050,Sultan Al Jabersaid at the Adipec oil and gas exhibition in Abu Dhabi on Monday. He did not name the companies. Tackling methane emissions is seen as a quick and effective climate solution because ton-for-ton it’s a far more potent agent of global warming than carbon dioxide in the short term. Al Jaber’s presidency of the United Nations-sponsored talks has sparked controversy because he’s also head of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., one of the world’s largest crude producers. He has argued the existing energy industry must play a role in a successful energy transition. “This industry can and must help drive the solutions,” Al Jaber said in a speech. “For too long, this industry has been viewed as part of the problem, that it’s not doing enough and in some cases even blocking progress. This is your opportunity to show the world that, in fact, you are central to the solution.” As well as rapid progress on reducing emissions from oil and gas production, the other two areas of focus for this year’s COP are speeding up the deployment of renewables and developing technology to abate emissions from energy-intensive industries like cement, Al Jaber said. This year’s COP takes place in Dubai in late November and early December and is expected to be more welcoming to representatives of the oil industry that previous versions of the event.

Now astrophysicists from the Niels Bohr Institute suggest a novel method which may help resolve this tension.We've known this ever since Edwin Hubble and other astronomers, some 100 years ago, measured the velocities of a number of surrounding galaxies. The galaxies in the universe are ""carried"" away from each other by this expansion, and therefore recedes from each other.The greater thedistancebetween two galaxies, the faster they move apart, and the precise rate of this movement is one of the most fundamental quantities in modern cosmology. The number that describes the expansion goes by the name ""the Hubble constant,"" appearing in multitude of different equations and models of the universe and its constituents.Hubble troubleTo understand the universe we must therefore know the Hubble constant as precisely as possible. Several methods exist to measure it; methods that are mutually independent but luckily give almost the same result.That is, almost. The intuitively easiest method to understand is, in principle, the same that Edwin Hubble and his colleagues used a century ago: Locate a bunch of galaxies, and measure their distances and speeds. In practice this is done by looking for galaxies with exploding stars, so-called supernovae. This method is complemented by another method that analyzes irregularities in the so-called cosmic background radiation; an ancient form of light dating back to shortly after the Big Bang.The two methods—the supernova method and the background radiation method—always gave slightly different results. But any measurement comes with uncertainties, and a few years back the uncertainties were substantial enough that we could blame those for the disparity.Nevertheless, as measurement techniques have improved, uncertainties have diminished, and we've now reached a point where we can state with a high degree of confidence that both cannot be correct.The root of this ""Hubble trouble""—whether it is unknown effects systematically biasing one of the results, or if it hints at new physics yet to be discovered—is currently one of astronomy's hottest topics.Crashing neutron stars may help with the answerOne of the greatest challenges lies in accurately determining the distances to galaxies. But ina recent studypublished inAstronomy & Astrophysics, Albert Sneppen who is a Ph.D. student in astrophysics at the Cosmic Dawn Center at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, proposed a novel method for measuring distances, thereby helping to settle the ongoing dispute.""When two ultra-compactneutron stars—which in themselves are the remnants of supernovae—orbit each other and ultimately merge, they go off in a new explosion; a so-called kilonova,"" Albert Sneppen explains. ""Werecently demonstratedhow this explosion is remarkedly symmetric, and it turns out that this symmetry not only is beautiful, but also incredibly useful.""Ina third studythat has just been published inThe Astrophysical Journal, the prolific Ph.D. student shows that kilonovae, despite their complexity, can be described by a single temperature. And it turns out that the symmetry and the simplicity of the kilonovae enable the astronomers to deduce exactly how much light they emit.Comparing this luminosity with how much light reaches Earth, the researchers can calculate how far away the kilonova is. They have thereby obtained a novel, independent method to calculate the distance to galaxies containing kilonovae.Darach Watson is an associate professor at the Cosmic Dawn Center and a co-author of the study. He explains: ""Supernovae, which until now have been used to measure the distances ofgalaxies, don't always emit the same amount of light. Moreover, they first require us to calibrate the distance using another type of stars, the so-called Cepheids, which in turn also must be calibrated. With kilonovae we can circumvent these complications that introduce uncertainties in the measurements.""Confirms one of the two methodsTo demonstrate its potential, the astrophysicists applied the method to a kilonova discovered in 2017. The result is a Hubble constant closer to the background radiation method, but whether the kilonova method can resolve the Hubble trouble, the researchers do not yet dare to state.""We only have this onecase studyso far, and need many more examples before we can establish a robust result,"" Albert Sneppen cautions. ""But our method at least bypasses some known sources of uncertainty, and is a very 'clean' system to study. It requires no calibration, no correction factor.""",en

This was a key takeaway from a new study led by the National University of Singapore's Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions under the Faculty of Science, which was published recently inNature Communications.As global populations rise and the need to feed the world grows,agricultural landsare expanding, sometimes at the expense of natural habitats such astropical forests. At the same time, croplands are also being abandoned due to factors such asland degradation, institutional and socioeconomic changes, disasters, armed conflict, and urbanization.Such abandoned croplands can be found in Europe, Russia, Central and East Asia and the Americas, and covered 101 million hectares globally between 1992 and 2020. This is almost equivalent to the size of Egypt, which has a total land area of about 100 million hectares. The abandonment rate over this period was about 3.6 million hectares a year, which means cropland about 50 times the size of Singapore was being abandoned every year.But the new study found that better management of these abandoned croplands could emerge as powerful nature-based solutions specifically through cultivation or reforestation. For example, if they are cultivated for food production, there could be less pressure to clear forests to open new croplands; thus contributing to the protection of existing forests. Alternatively, if abandoned croplands are reforested, the young forests could help pull planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and contribute toclimate change mitigation.Through analyzing geospatial data, the researchers found that of the 101 million hectares of globally abandoned cropland, 61 million hectares were suitable for cultivation. This would grow enough food to feed between 292 to 476 million people per year, although it would also result in emissions due to the need to clear the vegetation that had grown on the abandoned lands.Additionally, the researchers also established that 83 million hectares of globally abandoned cropland were suitable for reforestation. If this amount of land was completely planted up, the new forests could help to take in up to 1,066 million tons of carbon dioxide per year—almost equivalent to the annual emissions of Japan.Some areas of abandoned cropland overlapped between the two categories—researchers found that about half of the 101 million hectares of abandoned cropland was suitable for both cultivation and reforestation. Policymakers would have to weigh the opportunities and trade-offs of either choice, depending on their national circumstances and priorities, and in consideration of other factors.For example, local policies could affect the attractiveness of whether the land should be used for agriculture or reforestation. Market access and international trade openness could also affect these decisions. Still, the study highlights that a previously neglected land use type—abandoned croplands—could contribute to climate mitigation and food production, and should be factored in national land use decision making.Dr. Qiming Zheng, who led the study when he was a research fellow at CNCS, said, ""In the face of global challenges such asclimate changeand food scarcity, countries are often faced with the shortage of available land and the tough choice of whether land should be allocated forcarbon sequestrationor food production.""""But our study has found that abandoned cropland is a largely untapped resource that could help to achieve either or both aims. Nevertheless, it requires an integrative use of scientific analysis of the land suitability and achievable potentials, as well as context-specific local knowledge, to best unlock the potential of abandoned cropland.""",en

The government took temporary control of Carlsberg Group’s Russian unit Baltika in August, transferring the business to the Federal Property Management Agency. The Danish brewer has since said that it was shocked by the move and promised to take“reciprocal steps,”but has not taken any legal action so far. According to Kommersant, citing a ruling by the Arbitration Court of St. Petersburg and Leningrad Region dated September 25, 2023, Baltika has requested prohibiting the Federal Service for Intellectual Property Rospatent from making any changes to contracts for the brands Tuborg, Kronenbourg, Seth & Riley’s Garage, Holsten and LAV. In addition, Baltika has asked the court to stop Carlsberg from initiating a process in Denmark to terminate the framework license agreement. The Russian company explained the request by pointing out the potential significant losses it would suffer as a result of“the jurisdiction of disputes in Denmark and their termination.”The court has reportedly refused interim measures. According to Kommersant, there is currently no information in Danish courts about possible Carlsberg claims regarding the cancelation of Baltika’s licenses. Carlsberg was operating eight production facilities in Russia before announcing its exit from the country in March 2022 in the light of Western sanctions. Last year, the group took a $1.5 billion write-down on its Russian Baltika subsidiary. Under the Russian presidential decree, the Danish brewer retained ownership of the unit but no longer has any control or influence over it.

Both devices still use a DC barrel port for power input, but the newest Echo Show 8 does away with the archaic microUSB port that I'm sure no one even remembers being there on the older model.  Things are fairly similar up front too, with both smart displays having the same 8-in HD touchscreen display with a 1280x800 pixel resolution. However, the 3rd-gen model features an edge-to-edge glass facade that makes it look a bit more modern. The top bezel houses a 13MP front-facing camera similar to the one on the 2nd gen model, except for the fact that it's now placed in the center instead of being on the left. All the controls are still located on the top edge; these include buttons for volume adjustment and turning off the mic and camera. Here, you'll also find the microphone array, as well as a sliding switch for the mechanical camera shutter that comes in real handy at times when you want more privacy. The 3rd Gen and 2nd Gen Echo Show 8 are nearly the same size and weigh exactly the same. They also share the same display and front-facing camera, as well a few other key features. But as you can see from the table above, the real changes are mostly on the inside, and they make the latest model the best Amazon Echo Show currently available in the market. Amazon Echo Show 8 (3rd Gen) vs Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen): What enhancements does the newest version have? While the previous model has a MediaTek MT8183 SoC (System on Chip), the 3rd Gen Echo Show 8 is powered by Amazon's custom-designed AZ2 octa-core chipset. It utilizes a neural network engine that lets the device process most of its data locally instead of sending it over to the cloud. As explained by Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand, the AZ2 SoC allows for better facial and speech recognition, enabling a cool new feature called 'Adaptive Content' to work its magic. It automatically adjusts the content shown on the Echo Show 8's display based on your proximity to the smart display.  When you are not standing in front of the device, it can display information (e.g., time, weather, and news headlines) that can be read from afar. As soon as it detects you're nearby, the UI changes to bring up touch-friendly elements for quicker user interaction. These can be anything — from smart home controls to shortcuts for accessing and starting a video call — and they're all customizable. Speaking of video calls, the aforementioned centered camera makes framing yourself much easier. As with the previous model, there's also auto-framing support, so you'll stay in the camera's field of view even if you move around during a video call. The 3rd Gen Echo Show 8 features a pair of full-range 2-inch speakers and a passive bass radiator. This hardware is helped by spatial audio processing and Amazon's 'Room Adaption' technology, which optimizes sound by sensing the acoustics of the room. Combine all that, and you should get an improved and more immersive sound experience across everything from multimedia playback to video calls.  Last but not least, let's talk a bit about smart home features. Just like the previous model, the 3rd Gen Echo Show 8 allows you to manage and control some of the best Alexa devices, as well as summon Amazon's voice assistant to do stuff like setting alarms, asking about the weather, and much more. Both smart displays also work with Matter, the common connectivity standard that lets smart devices from competing ecosystems interoperate seamlessly. While the older model allows communication over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, the latest Echo Show 8 takes things even further by adding support for Thread and Zigbee mesh networking protocols, which make it a true smart home hub that can handle all your smart devices regardless of the ecosystem(s) they belong to. Amazon Echo Show 8 (3rd Gen) vs. Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen): Should you upgrade? There's no denying that the 3rd Gen Echo Show 8 packs in quite a few changes over its predecessor, including a centered front-facing camera for better video calls, improved audio quality for your favorite music and videos, and the ability to manage smart home devices from multiple ecosystems with little to no effort. The fact that it costs just $20 more than the older model makes it a no-brainer if you're planning to get one soon. But what if you already have the 2nd Gen Echo Show 8 that you got recently or even a while back? Should you just toss it in the bin and buy Amazon's newest smart display instead? Well, the answer to that depends on how you've been using the existing one since you got it.  Do you regularly connect with family and friends over video calls using the Echo Show 8 and think those could be a lot better? Do you often listen to your favorite tunes from some of the best music streaming services on this thing but find the audio output to be lacking, even more so as there's no 3.5mm audio port to hook up an external speaker? Has the usage experience (e.g., Alexa's responses to voice commands) become a little slow over time? If the answer to any (or all) of the above questions is yes, we recommend going ahead and upgrading to the 3rd Gen Echo Show 8. It offers a lot of goodies without raising the asking price too much. You won't have to keep adjusting yourself on video calls so that others can see you properly, and the newer chipset will make the everyday usage experience a bit smoother. Once you've upgraded, you can relocate your 2nd Gen Echo Show 8 to another place in your home and keep using it as a secondary smart display.  On the other hand, if the 2nd Gen Echo Show 8 that you already have is just used every now and then for listening to the occasional song or watching a quick recipe video, it makes little sense to upgrade. Similarly, if you're already fully invested in Amazon's smart home ecosystem and don't have (or plan on getting) any devices that work with rival ecosystems, or you couldn't care less about all this stuff altogether and just got your existing Echo Show 8 to play around with it, we suggest skipping the 3rd Gen model. It's also worth mentioning here that some features (e.g., Adaptive Content) will eventually come to the 2nd Gen Echo Show 8 via a future software update, so you won't be missing out on too much by not getting the newest version.   Latest and greatest Priced just $20 more than its predecessor, the 3rd generation Amazon Echo Show 8 offers a better-positioned front camera, improved sound output, and a proximity-based adaptive user experience.   Essential features, affordable price It may no longer be the newest thing in town, but Amazon's 2nd generation Echo Show 8 continues to be a solid smart display. It lets you make video calls, enjoy your favorite tunes and videos, control Alexa-enabled devices, and more.",en

TheEarfun EH100($100) are a set of triple-driver in-ear monitors (IEMs) with swappable tuning nozzles and theEarfun EA100($80) is a tiny digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and headphone amp with dual headphone jacks for both balanced and unbalanced connections. These are already pretty affordable prices, however, between October 2 and October 15, you can buy one or both at a significant discount. The price for each product has been discounted by 30% ($70 for the EH100 and $56 for the EA100), or you can buy them as a bundle and save 35% ($117 for the EH100 and EA100). The EH100 have an unusual driver architecture, featuring dual dynamic drivers for bass and midranges, with a custom balanced armature (BA) driver for high frequencies. The earbuds are made from aluminum and have a high-polish exterior surface and use a standard detachable 2-pin IEM connection. Earfun includes two sets of tuning nozzles, which it says can be used to vary the sound signature of the EH100: A balanced nozzle which, as the name implies, provides an even frequency response, and an ambient nozzle which accentuates sub- and mid-bass for those who prefer a boosted low-end. They come with an unbalanced, silver-plated copper cable with a full-metal 3.5mm jack, five sets of silicone eartips, and zippered hard-shell carrying case.  The EA100 is a slender, lightweightDAC/ampthat has a USB-C connection at one end and two headphone ports at the other (3.5mm unbalanced/4.4mm balanced). It comes with a short USB-C to USB-C cable for connections to PCs and smartphones, plus there’s a USB-C to USB-A adapter for computers that don’t have USB-C. Digital Trends asked why no Apple Lightning adapter is included and we were told that the additional cost, plus Apple’s recent move away from Lightning on theiPhone 15, were both factors in the decision. The EA100 can decode 32-bit/768kHz PCM and DSD512 thanks to its ESS ES9038Q2M chip with built-in clock jitter suppression, high-dynamic range, and low distortion. It’s also equipped with independent left and right amplifiers that provide a maximum power output of 195mW at 32 ohms, with a 121dB signal-to-noise ratio. That should be enough power to drive even relatively high-impedanceheadphonesand more than enough to power the 16 Ohm EH100. The EA100 has one feature that I’ve never seen on a DAC/amp before: A mode button that lets the DAC switch between UAC 2.0 and UAC 1.0 — the latter of which might be needed when using the EA100 with certain game consoles or PCs. An LED light embedded in the USB-C side of the dongle confirms the connection to the device and displays different color codes depending on the sample rate (or DSD) format being decoded. ",en

Lugansk is the capital of the Lugansk People’s Republic – one of the two former eastern Ukrainian regions that declared independence from Kiev in 2014 in the wake of the Western-backed Maidan coup in Kiev. Russia recognized its independence in February 2022, just days before the start of its military campaign in Ukraine. In autumn 2022, the Lugansk People’s Republic joined Russia, together with three other former Ukrainian territories following a series of referendums. Kiev has never recognized the results of the vote and called the referendums a“sham.”It still considers the four territories – as well as Crimea, which rejoined Russia in 2014 after a referendum– to be part of Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly stated that it was ready for peace talks with Kiev but only if the“reality on the ground”is recognized, which includes the four regions’ decision to be part of Russia. On Monday, Baerbock said that“every village… every meter”the Ukrainian troops seize from Russian forces brings Kiev closer to EU membership. She did not name any specific timeline linked to Ukraine’s potential accession to the bloc. The leaders of the EU member states are supposed to discuss the start of accession talks with Kiev at a meeting on Friday in Granada, Spain. The EU Commission is allegedly expected to provide a recommendation on the issue in November, with the final decision being taken in mid-December, Germany’s news outlet Stern reported. Earlier, Bloomberg reported that some member states have concerns about potential overextension of the bloc by accepting Ukraine and channeling resources toward it. Also, Politico reported in September that the EU believed Ukraine was a“very corrupt country,”adding that the prevalence of graft could affect its membership prospects.",en

We often do not involve women in respondingto environmental problems. To often, we exclude them in discussions on solutions to climate crisis.Patriarchal culture also creates unequal gender relations, with women being considered only capable of managing household and domestic work.Leaving women out when coming up with environmental solutions puts them in more vulnerable positions.Whenclimate change-related events occurs—such as more extreme weather,forest firesor floods—women and girls bear aheavier burdenand experience more severe impacts.Violence against womenis also on the rise amid global warming.However, we need to changethe narrativethat women are merely ""victims"" of climate crisis.In reality, women in the Global South countries also possess the abilities and strength toprotect the environment. They manifest their power to preserve the environment in various actions, both formal and informal, individual and collective.Women's movements across the Global SouthHistorically, women have played a big part in protecting the environment in Asian and South American countries.One example is theChipko movement in Indiain the 1970s.The Chipko movement started in 1974, when the Indigenous women and community of Reni village in India fought to protect the forest from logging that threatened their livelihood. They collectively took action by guarding and embracing trees to push back contractors and prevent deforestation.Their fight went global,making waves worldwide.Duringthe 1985 Nairobi Conferenceon Women from Third World Countries, women emphasized the importance of nature conservation and women's environmental actions. Testimonies from the Chipko movement and similar women's movements in other countries were discussed at this conference.Fighting for change in Mexico and BoliviaBesides the Chipko movement, there is a recent example from women in Zapotalito, a village within the Chacahua-Pastoría lagoon national park area in southern Mexico.They have endured a series of environmental challenges, includingdead fish, a dreadful ammonia smell, and a decline in air and water quality due to adam project and lime oil factory pollution.The women of Zapotalito worked together toclean the natural canal in the Coaxaca mangrove area. They used shovels and hoes for regular clean-ups in 2016.Even as they fought for change, they continued their daily routines. They cooked food, made tortillas, cleaned houses, cared for children, tended to pets and plants and caught fish for their families to eat, even amid bad environmental conditions.On another front, the women's movementin Chiquiacá, Bolivia,has been protecting the Tariquía Flora and Fauna National Reserve since 2017 from oil and gas companies' expansion into their precious area.In a bold move in 2019, they actually blocked the entrance to the conservation area for a whopping five months to prevent drilling equipment from being brought in.Chiquiacá women in action in Bolivia.The women of Chiquiacá also took their protest to the streets, actively hindering any development on their land. What began as a local movement has grown into a powerful collective action that's still going strong today. It's gained the support of thousands of people in Bolivia.Indonesian fisherwomen's leadershipIn Indonesia, fisherwomen in Central Java have been working to sustain their community amidstthe climate change since 2020. Rising sea levels have increased flood risks in their neighborhoods, forcing them to take action by engaging with policymakers, raising awareness and fundraising to build bridges.Unfortunately, women in these movements often face threats, intimidation and violence. Their enemies tried to undermine their action, by saying ""women should stay silent at home and take care of the kitchen"" Some of them receiveddeath threats.Despite these challenges, however, they continue their fight to protect their land.Growing global recognitionThe stories above have shown women are capable of making a difference in environmental activism, from their homes and communities to the national stage.The global community increasingly recognizes their efforts too. Since the 1990s, more international policies haveemphasized genderas acrucial elementin nature conservation and sustainable development.For example, the 1992Rio Declaration on Environment and Developmentacknowledges the vital role of women in environmental management and development.The Beijing Platform for Action, established in 1995, is a resolution that supports gender equality and empowerment of women worldwide.The reportsof the High-Level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Beijing Platform for Action in Asia and the Pacific highlight the critical link between environmental change and women's roles as managers and providers of natural resources.There's also the 2004United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which emphasizes the crucial role of women in drought-affected areas, particularly in rural regions of developing countries.Recent documents fromthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)highlight the pivotal role of local women's movements and Indigenous women in shaping climate policies and actions.Numerous policies also promote women's participation in the sustainable development agenda.But, not all countries adopt those policies.Better solutions through involving womenDespite being disproportionately affected by environmental damages, women continue to demonstrate their resilience and knowledge in tackling climate change.To empower women's activism, governments worldwide should formulate policies integrating women's roles in conservation and sustainable development strategies within their own nations.As for the public, initiating efforts to document women's activism is crucial.Both government and public actions are essential to avoid oversimplifying women's experiences across diverse countries, and to move beyond the narrative that portrays them solely as victims.These actions are fundamental in steering clear of oversimplifying the experiences ofwomenacross diverse countries. They are also the first steps towards solvingenvironmental problemsinnew and better ways.Provided byThe ConversationThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

To often, we exclude them in discussions on solutions to climate crisis.Patriarchal culture also creates unequal gender relations, with women being considered only capable of managing household and domestic work.Leaving women out when coming up with environmental solutions puts them in more vulnerable positions.Whenclimate change-related events occurs—such as more extreme weather,forest firesor floods—women and girls bear aheavier burdenand experience more severe impacts.Violence against womenis also on the rise amid global warming.However, we need to changethe narrativethat women are merely ""victims"" of climate crisis.In reality, women in the Global South countries also possess the abilities and strength toprotect the environment. They manifest their power to preserve the environment in various actions, both formal and informal, individual and collective.Women's movements across the Global SouthHistorically, women have played a big part in protecting the environment in Asian and South American countries.One example is theChipko movement in Indiain the 1970s.The Chipko movement started in 1974, when the Indigenous women and community of Reni village in India fought to protect the forest from logging that threatened their livelihood. They collectively took action by guarding and embracing trees to push back contractors and prevent deforestation.Their fight went global,making waves worldwide.Duringthe 1985 Nairobi Conferenceon Women from Third World Countries, women emphasized the importance of nature conservation and women's environmental actions. Testimonies from the Chipko movement and similar women's movements in other countries were discussed at this conference.Fighting for change in Mexico and BoliviaBesides the Chipko movement, there is a recent example from women in Zapotalito, a village within the Chacahua-Pastoría lagoon national park area in southern Mexico.They have endured a series of environmental challenges, includingdead fish, a dreadful ammonia smell, and a decline in air and water quality due to adam project and lime oil factory pollution.The women of Zapotalito worked together toclean the natural canal in the Coaxaca mangrove area. They used shovels and hoes for regular clean-ups in 2016.Even as they fought for change, they continued their daily routines. They cooked food, made tortillas, cleaned houses, cared for children, tended to pets and plants and caught fish for their families to eat, even amid bad environmental conditions.On another front, the women's movementin Chiquiacá, Bolivia,has been protecting the Tariquía Flora and Fauna National Reserve since 2017 from oil and gas companies' expansion into their precious area.In a bold move in 2019, they actually blocked the entrance to the conservation area for a whopping five months to prevent drilling equipment from being brought in.Chiquiacá women in action in Bolivia.The women of Chiquiacá also took their protest to the streets, actively hindering any development on their land. What began as a local movement has grown into a powerful collective action that's still going strong today. It's gained the support of thousands of people in Bolivia.Indonesian fisherwomen's leadershipIn Indonesia, fisherwomen in Central Java have been working to sustain their community amidstthe climate change since 2020. Rising sea levels have increased flood risks in their neighborhoods, forcing them to take action by engaging with policymakers, raising awareness and fundraising to build bridges.Unfortunately, women in these movements often face threats, intimidation and violence. Their enemies tried to undermine their action, by saying ""women should stay silent at home and take care of the kitchen"" Some of them receiveddeath threats.Despite these challenges, however, they continue their fight to protect their land.Growing global recognitionThe stories above have shown women are capable of making a difference in environmental activism, from their homes and communities to the national stage.The global community increasingly recognizes their efforts too. Since the 1990s, more international policies haveemphasized genderas acrucial elementin nature conservation and sustainable development.For example, the 1992Rio Declaration on Environment and Developmentacknowledges the vital role of women in environmental management and development.The Beijing Platform for Action, established in 1995, is a resolution that supports gender equality and empowerment of women worldwide.The reportsof the High-Level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Beijing Platform for Action in Asia and the Pacific highlight the critical link between environmental change and women's roles as managers and providers of natural resources.There's also the 2004United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which emphasizes the crucial role of women in drought-affected areas, particularly in rural regions of developing countries.Recent documents fromthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)highlight the pivotal role of local women's movements and Indigenous women in shaping climate policies and actions.Numerous policies also promote women's participation in the sustainable development agenda.But, not all countries adopt those policies.Better solutions through involving womenDespite being disproportionately affected by environmental damages, women continue to demonstrate their resilience and knowledge in tackling climate change.To empower women's activism, governments worldwide should formulate policies integrating women's roles in conservation and sustainable development strategies within their own nations.As for the public, initiating efforts to document women's activism is crucial.Both government and public actions are essential to avoid oversimplifying women's experiences across diverse countries, and to move beyond the narrative that portrays them solely as victims.These actions are fundamental in steering clear of oversimplifying the experiences ofwomenacross diverse countries. They are also the first steps towards solvingenvironmental problemsinnew and better ways.Provided byThe ConversationThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

They cooked food, made tortillas, cleaned houses, cared for children, tended to pets and plants and caught fish for their families to eat, even amid bad environmental conditions.On another front, the women's movementin Chiquiacá, Bolivia,has been protecting the Tariquía Flora and Fauna National Reserve since 2017 from oil and gas companies' expansion into their precious area.In a bold move in 2019, they actually blocked the entrance to the conservation area for a whopping five months to prevent drilling equipment from being brought in.Chiquiacá women in action in Bolivia.The women of Chiquiacá also took their protest to the streets, actively hindering any development on their land. What began as a local movement has grown into a powerful collective action that's still going strong today. It's gained the support of thousands of people in Bolivia.Indonesian fisherwomen's leadershipIn Indonesia, fisherwomen in Central Java have been working to sustain their community amidstthe climate change since 2020. Rising sea levels have increased flood risks in their neighborhoods, forcing them to take action by engaging with policymakers, raising awareness and fundraising to build bridges.Unfortunately, women in these movements often face threats, intimidation and violence. Their enemies tried to undermine their action, by saying ""women should stay silent at home and take care of the kitchen"" Some of them receiveddeath threats.Despite these challenges, however, they continue their fight to protect their land.Growing global recognitionThe stories above have shown women are capable of making a difference in environmental activism, from their homes and communities to the national stage.The global community increasingly recognizes their efforts too. Since the 1990s, more international policies haveemphasized genderas acrucial elementin nature conservation and sustainable development.For example, the 1992Rio Declaration on Environment and Developmentacknowledges the vital role of women in environmental management and development.The Beijing Platform for Action, established in 1995, is a resolution that supports gender equality and empowerment of women worldwide.The reportsof the High-Level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Beijing Platform for Action in Asia and the Pacific highlight the critical link between environmental change and women's roles as managers and providers of natural resources.There's also the 2004United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which emphasizes the crucial role of women in drought-affected areas, particularly in rural regions of developing countries.Recent documents fromthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)highlight the pivotal role of local women's movements and Indigenous women in shaping climate policies and actions.Numerous policies also promote women's participation in the sustainable development agenda.But, not all countries adopt those policies.Better solutions through involving womenDespite being disproportionately affected by environmental damages, women continue to demonstrate their resilience and knowledge in tackling climate change.To empower women's activism, governments worldwide should formulate policies integrating women's roles in conservation and sustainable development strategies within their own nations.As for the public, initiating efforts to document women's activism is crucial.Both government and public actions are essential to avoid oversimplifying women's experiences across diverse countries, and to move beyond the narrative that portrays them solely as victims.These actions are fundamental in steering clear of oversimplifying the experiences ofwomenacross diverse countries.

A copy of a letter from the Phnom Penh Municipal Court’s chief prosecutor, Chreung Khmao, said the trip by the members of the group Mother Nature Cambodia was “not necessary.” The letter, seen by The Associated Press, came in response to a travel request from the activists. Thon Ratha, 31, Phuong Keo Reaksmey, 22, and Long Khunthea, 25, asked for permission to make a Nov. 24- Dec, 1 trip to receive the award, which is sometimes characterized as the “Alternative Nobel.” Mother Nature Cambodia was co-winner of the award this year along with Phyllis Omido, a Kenyan community activist, and SOS Mediterranee, a humanitarian group that rescues migrants in the Mediterranean Sea. The Stockholm-based Right Livelihood Foundation said the winners “stand up to save lives, preserve nature and safeguard the dignity and livelihoods of communities around the world,"" and “fight for people’s right to health, safety, a clean environment and democracy.” It cited Mother Nature Cambodia for its “fearless and engaging activism to preserve Cambodia’s natural environment in the context of a highly restricted democratic space.” Cambodia’s government under long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen, who stepped down this year, showed little tolerance for challenges to the status quo. In June 2021, the three Cambodian activists were convicted of incitement to commit a felony for their activities in 2017-2020 to protect the country’s natural resources. They lost an appeal in December. Their 14-month prison sentences were suspended but they were barred from traveling outside Cambodia for three years without permission from the court. Am Sam Ath, a senior member of the Cambodian human rights organization Licadho, expressed regret that the court refused to let the activists make the journey. “They should have received encouragement to go by the court and Cambodian authorities because of their work for the sake of the country and because they have set a good example for the younger Cambodian generation,” Am Sam Ath said. Created in 1980, the annual Right Livelihood Award honors efforts that the prize founder, Swedish-German philanthropist Jakob von Uexkull, felt were being ignored by the Nobel Prizes. To date, 190 laureates from 74 countries have received the award. The foundation behind the prize has said this year's winners will be recognized at a Nov. 29 award presentation ceremony in Stockholm. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the climate and environment at: https://apnews.com/climate-and-environment",en

Two of the United States’ closest Arab allies are asking the Biden administration to formalize their military relationship with a wide-ranging agreement as Washington becomes uneasy aboutChina’s growing rolein the Middle East. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two of the US’ closest military partners in the Arab world, have called formore security supportfrom Washington of late, and both have indicated that in an increasingly multipolar world, their options aren’t limited to the US. “They (the Americans) don’t want to see Saudi Arabia shifting their armament from America to another place,” Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) told Fox News’ Bret Baierin an interviewlast month. Anwar Gargash, the UAE president’s diplomatic adviser, last month described the US’ involvement in the Middle East as “a positive thing.” Speaking at the Al-Monitor and Semafor Global Summit, the UAE official however stressed the importance of cementing that involvement so “that there are no vacuums” – which, he warned, would only “give opportunities for other players to move into.” It is important to move from an “informal” security arrangement “to something that’s formal,” he said at a conference in New York, calling for a new, “ironclad” security arrangement with the US. Saudi crown prince says normalization deal with Israel gets 'closer' every day The demand for a formal arrangement that would offer Gulf states a security umbrella and bind the US to protecting them in the face of military attacks has become an essential component in ties with the US. Gulf states have over the past few yearsfaced attacksthey have blamed on Iran and its proxies, and have found the US’ response to them  inadequate. “Only a substantive security commitment by the United States would be perceived by regional adversaries as a deterrent to their ambitions to topple the U.S.-led regional order of which Saudi Arabia is the anchor,” Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst,wrote in an articlefor the Hoover Institution, a public policy think tank at Stanford University, in July. “If the United States wants to fully leverage with Saudi Arabia its own capacity to project military power into the region, then it needs to reintroduce deterrence by making such power projection tangible and reliable.” A security pact is at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s talks with Washington over potential normalization of ties with Israel – which, if achieved, would mark a significant foreign policy win for President Joe Biden ahead of the 2024 US presidential elections. Last month, MBS for the first time publicly acknowledged the normalization talks, saying his country was moving “closer” each day to reaching a deal with Israel. Experts say the Gulf states may be disappointed as the US is unlikely to extend a blanket security agreement that could get it further bogged down in the Middle East’s conflicts and require a cumbersome legislative approval process in a Congress where Saudi Arabia remains unpopular due to its human rights record. Discussions over the potential agreement have not been made public, but experts have put forward a number of ideas, from treaties that recognize Gulf security as part of US national interest, to declaring the Gulf nations Major Non-NATO Allies, to a formal security commitment from the US such as those signed with Japan and South Korea. The US entered defense treaties withTokyoandSeoulin the 1950s, pledging to defend the two nations in case of armed attack. Both nations have a sizable US military presence and also enjoy Major Non-NATO Ally status. The Major Non-NATO Ally status is a US designation that provides partners with defense trade and security cooperation benefits. While it is seen as symbol of close partnership with some military and economic privileges, it doesn’t entailany security commitmentsfrom the US. Among the Gulf states, Bahrain, which hosts the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet, was the first to be declared a MNNA in 2002. Qatar, which is home to the US Central Command, was added to the list last year. In the shadow of US-China rivalry, Arab allies tread delicate ground Saudi Arabia and the UAE are likely asking for a comprehensive treaty, similar to that signed with Japan and South Korea, said Jean-Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the Middle East Institute of the National University of Singapore and author of “New Military Strategies in the Gulf: The Mirage of Autonomy in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar.” They may also be asking that Washington ease access to arms sales and potentially increase the US military presence in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, he added, potentially to match the presence in Qatar or Bahrain. It is however unclear if the US would commit to a treaty that would require it to come to the Gulf states’ defense in case of attack. “This can only be conferred through a Senate-ratified treaty,” said David Des Roches, a professor at the Near East South Asia Center for Security Studies and former Pentagon official who worked on the Middle East. “In the absence of a true breakthrough (such as Saudi recognition of Israel), it’s hard to see the Biden administration presenting any treaty, even a weaker commitment… to the Senate,” Des Roches told CNN. The president can offer some concessions without Senate ratification, he said, but that won’t meet Gulf states’ requirements. “The Saudis and others have seen how a non-treaty arrangement can be undone,” he said, referring to the Gulf perception that the US is disengaging from the region. “(They) are unlikely to be satisfied with anything short of a binding treaty commitment.” Some experts say that any agreement with the US will necessarily impact Gulf states’ autonomy over their own defense affairs, as the Biden administration is likely to ask for guarantees that its Arab allies reduce engagement with rivals like China and Russia, both of whom have bolstered ties with the Gulf states of late. The UAE in 2021 suspended amulti-billion-dollar dealto buy US-made F-35 fighter jets amid Abu Dhabi’s growing frustration with Washington’s attempts to limit Chinese technology sales to the Gulf state. At the time, the sale was seen as a cornerstone of the UAE’s decision to normalize ties with Israel a year prior. Asked if the UAE is still interested in procuring F-35 jets from the US, Gargash last monthsaid it is, but stressed that there are “sovereign requirements” that need to be settled with the US. Des Roches said that with a new security pact, the US is likely to ask the Gulf states to “curtail the fielding of any Chinese technology which has the potential to compromise US weaponry in service with Gulf countries.” But Gulf states, he said, “are likely to regard such restrictions as an infringement on their sovereignty.” Nevertheless, said Samaan, the demand for a new security arrangement with the US shows that Washington remains the Gulf states’ first port of call when it comes to security matters, despite the threats about finding alternatives. “We’re back to business as usual,” he said, where Gulf states are turning to Washington and asking for bigger security packages – even if recent public rhetoric has shown some disconnect between what those states will publicly say and what they really want.

It’s the first time the British Army’s activities are being examined in such a way since 1963, when Kenya gained independence from the UK. The inquiry is led by the National Assembly’s Departmental Committee on Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Relations. MPs put out a call for the public to submit petitions in respect of any alleged army crimes, and the investigations are to start in October, with the final report to be presented to the parliament by the end of the year. This will definitely have consequences for a defense deal between Kenya and the UK. Kenya was a British colony from the late 19th century up to 1963. British soldiers continued to stay in Kenya after independence under bilateral security agreements. Moreover, British officers held leading positions in the command of Kenyan troops. Since then, Britain has continued to have a major influence on Kenya’s armed forces, and Kenyan officers continue to be trained in Britain and the United States. Kenya is a crucial partner for the UK’s entire African policy. British troops are currently in Kenya under a Defense Cooperation Agreement signed between the governments of Kenya and the UK in 2015 and extended in 2021. BATUK is a permanent support training unit, while the military base at Nanyuki, to the north of Nairobi, is Britain’s largest military facility in Africa. In recent years, the British Army and the Kenya Defense Force held several major joint exercises from BATUK, involving 600 Kenyan troops and more than 4,000 British soldiers. However, there are also serious questions about how Kenya benefits from this cooperation. According to publicly available data, London allocates only about 1.2 billion Kenyan shillings ($11 million) annually to the defense partnership with Nairobi, which is an extremely low cost for access to two military sites and 13 training areas (the UK invested only $55 million in the defense partnership with Kenya from 2016 to 2021). This remains inadequate even with the social projects that the British Army seeks to implement in the country ($265,000 for all community projects from 2016 to 2021). (All dollar amounts are based on the 2021 exchange rate.) While about 4,000 Kenyan soldiers are trained annually at Camp Archer’s Post under the supervision of the British military, and more than 1,000 of them are assigned to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), Kenya continues to face serious security threats. The summer of 2023 witnessed increased activity by the terrorist group al-Shabab in the regions bordering Somalia, with many attacks occurring directly inside Kenya. This means that Kenyan forces are still not up to the task of securing their territory. There has been growing concern in Kenya, and calls to review military cooperation with the UK. Although the current cooperation agreement between Kenya and the UK was renewed in October 2021, the agreement had remained unratified until April 2023, as the process was delayed due to Kenya’s presidential election and massive local opposition to the agreement. The BATUK investigation is the first time the British Army’s activities in Kenya will be examined in this way since 1963. The decision to launch an investigation followed numerous complaints made by residents and local authorities about the way British soldiers behaved in Laikipia County. In the Archer’s Post area, home to one of the firing ranges used by the British Army in Kenya, soldiers regularly left large quantities of explosives, resulting in numerous casualties and injuries among local residents. Unexploded mines particularly affect Kenya’s two largest nomadic groups, the Samburu and Maasai, who often suffer the effects of British troops’ exercises. The problem was already urgent at the beginning of the 21st century, when the number of victims exceeded 1,000, and the British Ministry of Defense was forced to pay £5 million to farmers and their families who were injured and killed. Another major concern of the local population has been the use of white phosphorus in British Army exercises. Local residents complain of serious health problems following the use of such ammunition. Since 2017, the British Army has used white phosphorus 15 times in Kenya, without warning citizens about the nature of its effects on humans. In addition, in late 2021, exercises by the British Army in the Lolldaiga Hills area led to a major forest fire that caused the death of Kenyans and widespread damage to nature. While Nanyuki has become a center for sexual services in Kenya because of the Kenyan and British soldiers deployed in the town, British soldiers have been implicated in numerous sexual abuse scandals. The most famous case involved the murder of a 21-year-old Kenyan woman in 2012. A British soldier is suspected of the killing, but has not been extradited to Kenya. This high-profile case led Kenyan MPs to vote to change the defense agreement in 2023. Now, British soldiers can be tried for murder and other serious crimes committed against Kenyans in Kenya. Given the problematic nature of the British military presence, their deployment in Kenya brings back negative memories of the Mau-Mau rebellion (an armed uprising by the Kikuyu people in the 1950s against colonial rule, brutally suppressed by the British). Many Kenyans continue to view Britain as a colonial power, and the prolonged presence of British soldiers raises questions about Kenya’s sovereignty and its level of independence from Britain. Kenya holds a critical strategic position in East Africa, with access to the traditionally volatile Horn of Africa, Central Africa and the long coastline of the Indian Ocean. Its geographical position, especially its Indian Ocean access, gives Kenya great geopolitical importance. It is among the largest countries on the continent in terms of demographics (over 55 million people live there) and economics (it is one of the seven largest economies on the continent). Kenya is the main transportation hub of East Africa, and its largest port, Mombasa, is a key gateway to connect East and Central Africa with the rest of the world. This position explains the interest of external actors in the country. The Western military presence in Kenya is not limited to the British contingent. Kenya is considered by Western countries to be the front line of defense against terrorist threats, including regional offshoots of Al-Qaeda, and the Kenya-Somalia border presents a major security challenge. US Africa Command troops are stationed at a military facility in the Manda Bay in Kenya. The primary mission of this military base is to combat the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab. In early 2020, this military facility was attacked by terrorists, resulting in increased defenses and more US soldiers stationed in Kenya. In early 2023, Nairobi approached Washington to pay for the expansion of the joint anti-terrorism military facility, which started a serious discussion in the US over concerns that the denial would lead to increased Chinese influence in Kenya. According to a 2021 US Department of Defense report, Kenya is one of the destinations that China is actively considering for a military base in East Africa, in addition to the existing one in Djibouti. Over the past two decades, China’s huge investment in erecting infrastructure has made Beijing Kenya’s largest creditor. The rapprochement with China has reflected the reshaping of Kenya’s foreign policy in the early 21st century and the promotion of the“Look East” vision. Beijing’s financing and construction of major projects such as highways and railroads in Kenya are part of China’s efforts under the Belt and Road Initiative. Today, China accounts for about 20% of Kenya’s total $34 billion external debt (64% of the country’s bilateral external debt). In addition, according to SIPRI, the countries’ military-technical cooperation also grew between 2000 and 2022, with China becoming Kenya’s second-largest arms supplier. Despite this, Kenya’s new president, William Ruto, is seeking to diversify foreign relations and reduce dependence on China by increasing engagement with the West. This is evidenced by his increased contacts with US diplomatic officials, his personal attendance at the US-Africa Leaders’ Summit in Washington, his neglect of the Russia-Africa summit, and only the foreign minister’s attendance at the BRICS summit. The new“Look West”may be related to the search for new investments to accelerate local production in the face of increasing debt to China. *** The current statements about the investigation of BATUK’s activities and the possibility of reviewing the defense cooperation agreement with Britain are largely an attempt to ease the internal situation related to serious dissatisfaction with injustice and security threats to the local population. But what’s more important is that the investigation is a crucial signal to Britain. Keeping in mind the importance of the military facility in Kenya for the entire British presence in Africa, the risk of losing it could be a serious challenge to the UK’s broader ambitions not only in the region but also globally.",en

In a recent interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed the future possibilities of VR and the Metaverse. The interview served as a debutfor Meta's new Codec avatarsthat use scanning technology to build 3D models of the user's face. During the interview, which took place in the Metaverse, Fridman said: ""I would love to talk to people who are no longer here that are loved ones. So if you look into the future, is that something you think about?"" Zuckerberg acknowledged it was a complex idea but said there was ""probably some balance"" for the concept of creating a virtual version of a deceased person by using VR and AI technology. He told Fridman: ""If someone has lost a loved one and is grieving, there may be ways in which being able to interact or relive certain memories could be helpful."" He added there was also an extent to which this could become ""unhealthy."" ""I'm not an expert in that, so I think we'd have to study that and understand it in more detail,"" he added. Representatives for Zuckerberg did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, made outside normal working hours. Fridman was impressed by how realistic Meta's new avatars were – a vast improvement from its previous attempts with the technology that were savagely mocked online. One cartoonish image of Zuckerberg's early metaverse avatar outside a virtual version of the Eiffel Tower posted on social mediafamously became the target of internet memes. Meta has struggled to maintainconsumer and investor interestin its Metaverse after being hyped as the next big thing. Reality Labs, the division that handles metaverse work, lost nearly$14 billion in 2022and was hit by layoffs.",en

A court in Cambodia has prevented three environmental activists… [+278 chars]",Cambodia,"PHNOM PENH: A court in Cambodia on Monday barred three environmental activists who are serving suspended prison sentences for their advocacy work from travelling to Sweden next month to receive the prestigious Right Livelihood Award. A copy of a letter from the Phnom Penh Municipal Court's chief prosecutor, Chreung Khmao, said the trip by the members of the group Mother Nature Cambodia was ""not necessary."" The letter, seen by The Associated Press, came in response to a travel request from the activists. Thon Ratha, 31, Phuong Keo Reaksmey, 22, and Long Khunthea, 25, asked for permission to make a November 24-Dec, 1 trip to receive the award, which is sometimes characterised as the ""Alternative Nobel."" Mother Nature Cambodia was co-winner of the award this year along with Phyllis Omido, a Kenyan community activist, and SOS Mediterranee, a humanitarian group that rescues migrants in the Mediterranean Sea. The Stockholm-based Right Livelihood Foundation said the winners ""stand up to save lives, preserve nature and safeguard the dignity and livelihoods of communities around the world,"" and ""fight for people's right to health, safety, a clean environment and democracy."" It cited Mother Nature Cambodia for its ""fearless and engaging activism to preserve Cambodia's natural environment in the context of a highly restricted democratic space."" Cambodia's government under long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen, who stepped down this year, showed little tolerance for challenges to the status quo. In June 2021, the three Cambodian activists were convicted of incitement to commit a felony for their activities in 2017-2020 to protect the country's natural resources. They lost an appeal in December. Their 14-month prison sentences were suspended but they were barred from travelling outside Cambodia for three years without permission from the court. Am Sam Ath, a senior member of the Cambodian human rights organisation Licadho, expressed regret that the court refused to let the activists make the journey. ""They should have received encouragement to go by the court and Cambodian authorities because of their work for the sake of the country and because they have set a good example for the younger Cambodian generation,"" Am Sam Ath said. Created in 1980, the annual Right Livelihood Award honors efforts that the prize founder, Swedish-German philanthropist Jakob von Uexkull, felt were being ignored by the Nobel Prizes. To date, 190 laureates from 74 countries have received the award. The foundation behind the prize has said this year's winners will be recognized at a November 29 award presentation ceremony in Stockholm.",en

If students understand howmemoryworks, they can prioritize effective study habits. This will help for exams as well as their learning in the longer term.What is memory?According tocognitive psychology(the study of our mental processes), there arethreedistinct types of memory. Each plays a different role in effective study:Sensory memorytemporarily holds vast amounts of new informationfrom our senses. This includes everything we have just seen, heard, touched or tasted. If we pay attention to that information, it moves into working memory for processing. If we don't pay attention, it is discarded.Working memoryis our brain's control center. All consciouscognitive activity, including remembering, calculating, planning, problem-solving, decision-making and critical thinking happens in our working memory. However, if we have too much on our minds, working memory can easily becomeoverloaded. This makes it important to offload knowledge and skills to long-term memory.Long-term memoryis our brain's library. When new knowledge or skills are well practiced, they are ""encoded"" from working memory and intolong-term memory. Here they are stored in vast networks called schemas. To use those knowledge and skills again, we retrieve those schemas back into working memory. The more we encode and retrieve knowledge and skills, the stronger those memory pathways become. Well-learned schemas can be retrieved automatically, which creates space in working memory for new thinking and learning.How to help your memory when preparing for examsNot everyone likes exams and educators often debate their advantages and disadvantages.But if you are a student who is studying for exams right now, here are some tips to help you use your time well:Create the conditions for attention: put your phone away and remove distractions. Remember,your attention is neededto bring information into working memory and keep it there. Loss of attention, or mind wandering, can result in poorer learning. Harvard professor of psychology Dan Schachter calls absent-mindedness one of the ""seven sins of memory"".Consider your subject area: different disciplines ask different kinds of questions and you should study with these in mind. In a Year 12 Englishexam, for example, you might be asked to write a response about your interpretation of a particular text. So don't just re-read the text; effective study involves drawing out themes and insights, practicing your arguments and seeking feedback.Minimize 'shallow' study: most students reportre-reading and highlightingtext when studying. But these are less effective than other study techniques. Shallow study orencodingfocuses more on surface features andless on meaning. This encourages rote recall over genuine understanding and leads to poorer learning. Inone study, re-reading a textbook twice in a row offered no advantage over reading it for the first time.Maximize 'deep' study: this involves actively using the information you are studying. Depending on your discipline, this might includeanswering practice questions, constructing your own questions,summarizing, identifying themes, evaluating existing arguments,making decisions, or explaining concepts to others. This deep encoding results in stronger schematic networks, which are more easily reactivated when you need them.Move beyond worked examples: worked examples are step-by-step illustrations of the processes to solve a problem. They can bepowerful starting pointsbecause they show you how to use a particular strategy. They also help to reduce working memory load. But as youbecome more expert, it is more effective to draw those strategies from long-term memory yourself.Take breaks: research with Australianuniversity studentsshows even a five-minute rest break can support attention—the gateway to learning. Researchusing brain scansalso shows rest can help you consolidate memories.Don't cram: the so-called ""spacing effect"" shows memory andconceptual understandingboth benefit fromdistributedrather than massed learning. This means six half-hour sessions are better for learning than one three hour block.Mix up your study: this could meanvaryingquestions and activities, so your brain is forced to compare, contrast, refine, and draw distinctions between concepts and approaches. This is known as ""interleaving"", and has been shown to boost learning in subjects such as math, music and medicine.Don't skip sleep: sleep is crucial for theconsolidationof memory orsolidifyingnew connections or insights you have made.Give yourself enough time: unfortunately, there are no shortcuts here! Each time youpracticedrawing specific knowledge and skills from long-term memory into working memory, you are etching a memory super-highway.

Within each of these regions, there is little difference between where birds make their homes and other sites, suggesting they could shift if they had to. This provides a ray of hope in an otherwise bleak outlook.Emperor penguins may be the only birds to rarely set foot on land. They are unique among penguin species in that they breed on sea ice during the harsh Antarctic winter.We know that they need ""fast ice""—the coastal sea ice attached to the Antarctic continent or ice shelves. But they actually inhabit a range of fast-ice locations that differ in the timing of ice formation, how much ice forms and breaks, and even how close they get to other penguin species.Depending on where they are along the Antarctic coast, Emperors make use of the habitat available to them. Their behavior may be flexible enough to allow some colonies to cope better in a warming world.Why fast ice is importantEmperor penguins rely on fast ice as a stable platform for theirbreeding season. Female Emperors lay their eggs and the males incubate them for about two and a half months.Even though Antarctica's sea ice is diminishing, this refers to a measure known as ""sea ice extent,"" which includes all sea ice covering the polar ocean, whether it is fast ice or drifting pack ice.A decrease in sea ice extent is not necessary linearly linked to a drop in the area covered by fast ice (although the reverse is true).If fast ice were to disappear, we would expect more than 90% of Emperor colonies to become functionally extinct by the end of the century. However, our study suggests that in the short to medium term, we should consider the differences in the penguins' breeding habitats when we think about ways to protect them.Emperors are unlikely to move farBy looking a little closer at different fast-ice habitats, we found Emperor penguins have certain preferences. The persistence of the ice (how long it lasts into the summer) was important because chicks had more time to develop their water-proof swimming feathers.In some cases, being close to Adélie penguins made a difference. In other cases, Emperors preferred sites with shallow ocean depths below the colony.Our results suggest that two of these habitat conditions support larger colonies: stable fast ice that lasts throughout the breeding season (with only small changes in the growth and retreat seasonal cycle) and a good balance between a fast-ice platform that is wide enough to raise chicks but close enough to the ocean to get food for them.We need further studies to clarify these links and the relationship betweenpopulation sizeand habitat quality. In our study, we weren't able to consider prey availability and there may be other factors that play an important role.Previousresearchhas already shown that Emperor penguins have limited capacity to disperse to find more suitable climate refuges. This is supported by the genetic partitioning among the penguin populations in different Antarctic regions we studied.It is therefore unlikely Emperors would move far to avoid more severe climate impacts, even if ""better"" habitats existed and could host larger colonies.Protecting penguin habitatClimate change is currently one of the main pressures driving Emperor penguins closer to extinction.However, the latestglobal assessmentby the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) clearly identified fishing activities as historic and current drivers of the erosion of marine biodiversity worldwide.This is also true for Antarctica. While fishing pressure there is limited to a fraction of the global fishing fleet, some of the largest vessels target krill, a tiny shrimp-like crustacean consumed by many Antarctic predators, including Emperor penguins.Withclimate modelspredicting further reductions in sea ice extent, new fishing grounds could open and amplify pressure on other Antarctic wildlife.If we want to live in a world with Emperor penguins, the most important thing to do would be to cut greenhouse gas emissions steeply. Another key action could be to prevent fishing in areas whereclimate changewill have the most impact.In this respect, truly protected areas are one conservation tool at our disposal.

They are unique among penguin species in that they breed on sea ice during the harsh Antarctic winter.We know that they need ""fast ice""—the coastal sea ice attached to the Antarctic continent or ice shelves. But they actually inhabit a range of fast-ice locations that differ in the timing of ice formation, how much ice forms and breaks, and even how close they get to other penguin species.Depending on where they are along the Antarctic coast, Emperors make use of the habitat available to them. Their behavior may be flexible enough to allow some colonies to cope better in a warming world.Why fast ice is importantEmperor penguins rely on fast ice as a stable platform for theirbreeding season.

Our results suggest that two of these habitat conditions support larger colonies: stable fast ice that lasts throughout the breeding season (with only small changes in the growth and retreat seasonal cycle) and a good balance between a fast-ice platform that is wide enough to raise chicks but close enough to the ocean to get food for them.We need further studies to clarify these links and the relationship betweenpopulation sizeand habitat quality. In our study, we weren't able to consider prey availability and there may be other factors that play an important role.Previousresearchhas already shown that Emperor penguins have limited capacity to disperse to find more suitable climate refuges. This is supported by the genetic partitioning among the penguin populations in different Antarctic regions we studied.It is therefore unlikely Emperors would move far to avoid more severe climate impacts, even if ""better"" habitats existed and could host larger colonies.Protecting penguin habitatClimate change is currently one of the main pressures driving Emperor penguins closer to extinction.However, the latestglobal assessmentby the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) clearly identified fishing activities as historic and current drivers of the erosion of marine biodiversity worldwide.This is also true for Antarctica. While fishing pressure there is limited to a fraction of the global fishing fleet, some of the largest vessels target krill, a tiny shrimp-like crustacean consumed by many Antarctic predators, including Emperor penguins.Withclimate modelspredicting further reductions in sea ice extent, new fishing grounds could open and amplify pressure on other Antarctic wildlife.If we want to live in a world with Emperor penguins, the most important thing to do would be to cut greenhouse gas emissions steeply.

Now we have two,” said Dr Ghebreyesus. “Demand for the RTS,S vaccine far exceeds supply, so this second vaccine is a vital additional tool to protect more children faster, and to bring us closer to our vision of a malaria-free future.”The WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, emphasised the importance of this recommendation for the continent, saying: “This second vaccine holds real potential to close the huge demand-and-supply gap. Delivered to scale and rolled out widely, the two vaccines can help bolster malaria prevention and control efforts and save hundreds of thousands of young lives in Africa from this deadly disease.”At least 28 countries in Africa plan to introduce a WHO-recommended malaria vaccine as part of their national immunisation programmes.Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance has approved providing technical and financial support to roll out malaria vaccines to 18 countries.WHO also noted that the RTS,S vaccine will be rolled out in some African countries in early 2024, and the R21 malaria vaccine is expected to become available to countries in mid-2024.According to Moeti, Nigeria has seen major progress but accounts for around 27 per cent of the global burden of malaria cases.Moeti noted that Nigeria’s malaria incidence has fallen by 26 per cent since 2000, from 413 per 1000 to 302 per 1000 in 2021, and malaria deaths also fell by 55 per cent, from 2.1 per 1000 population to 0.9 per 1000 population.“Drivers of this continuing disease burden include the size of Nigeria’s population, making scaling up intervention challenging; suboptimal surveillance systems, which pick up less than 40 per cent of the country’s malaria data; inadequate funding to ensure universal interventions across all states; and health-seeking behaviour, where people use the private sector, with limited regulation, preferentially,” she stated.

The recommendation follows advice from the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation and the Malaria Policy Advisory Group and was endorsed by the WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, following its regular biannual meeting held on September 25 -29.The global health body disclosed this on Monday, in a press statement.In April, Nigeria became the second country to approve the R21 malaria vaccine, after Ghana.The R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford and manufactured and scaled up by the Serum Institute of India, is only the second vaccine the world has seen for a disease that has caused untold suffering for millennia.WHO also issued recommendations on the advice of SAGE for new vaccines for dengue and meningitis, along with immunisation schedules and product recommendations for COVID-19.WHO also issued key immunisation programmatic recommendations on polio, Immunisation Agenda 2030, and recovering the immunisation programme.The R21 vaccine is the second malaria vaccine recommended by WHO, following the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, which received a WHO recommendation in 2021.“Both vaccines are shown to be safe and effective in preventing malaria in children and, when implemented broadly, are expected to have high public health impact,” the statement read partly.Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, places a particularly high burden on children in the African Region, where nearly half a million children die from the disease each year.WHO said the demand for malaria vaccines is unprecedented; however, available supply of RTS,S/AS01 vaccine is limited.Related NewsHow to eliminate viral hepatitis in Africa by 2030 - ExpertsWHO urges Israel to withdraw evacuation order for hospitalsWHO condemns strike on Gaza hospitalIn response to the high demand for the first-ever malaria vaccine, 12 countries in Africa were in July allocated a total of 18 million doses of RTS,S/AS01 for the 2023–2025 period.The allocations were made to Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda.However, the addition of R21 to the list of WHO-recommended malaria vaccines is expected to result in sufficient vaccine supply to benefit all children living in areas where malaria is a public health risk.“As a malaria researcher, I used to dream of the day we would have a safe and effective vaccine against malaria.

Now, eight months later, the British government is fully embracing the fringe conspiracy and placing it at the heart of government policy. “Right across our country, there is a Labour-backed movement to make cars harder to use, to make driving more expensive, and to remove your freedom to get from A to B how you want,” Tory MP Mark Harper told the party conference in Manchester on this morning. “I am calling time on the misuse of so-called 15-minute cities,” he added. A 15-minute city is an urban planning concept where all amenities are available within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. In the wake of Covid-19 lockdowns, a conspiracy arose claiming it as part of a global plot to allow governments to control their populations. “What is sinister, and what we shouldn’t tolerate, is the idea that local councils can decide how often you go to the shops, and that they can ration who uses the roads and when, and that they police it all with CCTV,” Harper said this morning. Harper’s comments come just eight months after fellow Tory MP Nick Fletcher was mocked for voicing his support for the conspiracy theory in the House of Commons. Fletcher told his colleague that the idea of 15-minute cities was an “international socialist concept” and that it will “cost our personal freedom.” In recent months, protests against measures introduced by councils across the UK to lower speed limits and bring in low-traffic neighborhoods saw the conspiracy around 15-minute cities gain traction, and last Friday, September 29, the government unveiled a new transport plan that directly references the conspiracy.",en

After reading about the effects of climate change and how little farmers make—typically $0.40 per cup—you figure it might be time to change your usual beans and buy something more ethical. Perusing the shelves in the coffee aisle, though, you see too many choices.First up is the red tub of Folgers ""100% Colombian,"" a kitchen staple—""lively with a roasted and rich finish."" On the side of the tub, you seethe icon of Juan Valdezwith his donkey, Conchita—a fictional mascot representing the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation.Next might be Starbucks ""Single-Origin Colombia."" One side of the green bag tells ""the story"" of the beans, describing ""treacherous dirt roads"" to ""6,500 feet of elevation"" that are ""worth the journey every time."" The other shows a QR code and promises Starbucks is ""Committed to 100% Ethical Coffee Sourcing in partnership with Conservation International.""Then again, you've heard that a ""better"" choice would be to buy from local cafes. The bag from your local roaster introduces you to La Familia Vieira of Huila, Colombia, who have worked ascoffee farmersfor four generations at 1,600 meters above sea level—about a mile. But then there's a flood of unfamiliar lingo: the 88-point anerobic-processedcoffeewas sourced directly from an importer who has a six-year relationship with the family, paid $3.70 per pound at farmgate, and $6.10 per pound FOB at a time when the C-market price was $1.60 per pound.If you're about ready to toss in the towel, you're hardly alone. Consumers are often asked to make more responsible choices. Yet when it comes to commodity goods like coffee, the complex production chain can turn an uncomplicated habit into a complicated decision.As a coffee enthusiast andmarketing professor who researches marketplace justice, I've long been fascinated with how ethics and coffee consumption are intertwined. Before COVID-19, my familyadopted a cat and named him Yukro, after a coffee-producing community in Ethiopia. While we were quarantining at home, I ordered Yukro-originating coffee from as many roasters as I could find to try to understand how consumers were supposed to make an informed choice.Paradoxically, the more information I gleaned, the less I knew how to make a responsible decision. Indeed, prior research has indicated thatinformation overload increases the paradox of choice; this is no different when factoring in ethical information. Additionally, as with a lot of consumer-facing information,it can be difficult to tell what information is relevant or credible.Marketers attempt to simplify this overload by using buzzwords that sound good but may not get across much nuance. However, you might consider some of these terms when trying to decide between ""100% Colombian"" and the Vieira family.Fair tradeAs a benchmark, the coffee industry typically uses the ""C-price"":the traded priceon the New York Intercontinental Exchange for a pound of coffee ready for export. ""Fair trade"" implies the coffee is fairly traded, often with the goal of paying farmers minimum prices—and fixed premiums—above the C-price.There are a few different fair trade certifications, such asFairtrade AmericaorFair Trade Certified. Each of these has its own, voluntary certification standards linked with the associated organization. Yetobtaining certificationcan come at significant additional cost for farms or importers.In contrast, some importers, or even roasters, have established relationships with specific farms, rather than buying beans at auction on the open market. These relationships potentially allow the importers to work directly with farmers over multi-year periods to improve the coffee quality and conditions. Longer-term commitment can provide farmers more certainty in times when the C-price is below their cost of production.Yet these arrangements can be just as volatile for farmers if the importers they've committed to cannot find roasters interested in buying their beans—beans they could have sold at auction themselves.100% arabicaThere are several species of coffee, butapproximately 70% of the world's productioncomes from the arabica species, which grows well at higher altitudes. Like with wine, there are several varieties of arabica, and they tend to be a bit sweeter than other species—making arabica the ideal species for satisfying consumers.In other words, a label like ""100% arabica"" is meant to signal deliciousness and prestige—though it's about as descriptive as calling a bottle of pinot noir ""100% red.""When it comes to the environment, though, arabica isn't necessarily a win. Many arabica varieties are susceptible to climate change-related conditions such as coffee rust—a common fungusthat spreads easily and can devastate farms—or drought.Other coffee species such as robusta orthe less common eugenioidesare more climate-change resistant, reducing costs of production for farmers, and arecheaper on commodity markets. However, they have a bit of adifferent taste profilethan what folks are normally used to, which could mean lower earnings for farmers who make the switch, but could also provide new opportunities in areas where coffee was not previously farmed or to new markets of consumers' tastes.Single-originIf someone labeled a peach as ""American,"" a consumer would rightly wonder where exactly it came from. Similarly, ""single-origin"" is a very broad description that could mean the coffee came from ""Africa"" or ""Ethiopia"" or ""Jimma Zone""—even the zone's specific town of ""Agaro."" ""Single-estate"" at least gives slightly more farm-level information, though even this information may be tough to come by.Consumers have tended to want their coffee's journey from seed to cup to betraceable and transparent, which implies that everyone along the production chain is committed to equity—and ""single-origin"" appears to provide those qualities.As a result, some coffee marketers invest quite a bit in being able to craft a narrative that emotionally resonates with consumers and makes them feel ""connected"" to the farm. Others have developedblockchain solutionswhere each step along the coffee's journey, from bean to retail, is documented in a database that consumers can look at. Since blockchain data are immutable, the information a consumer gets from scanning a QR code on a label of a coffee bag should provide a clear chain of provenance.Shade-grownShade-grown labels indicate that farms have adopted a more environmentally sustainable method, using biomatter like dead leaves as natural fertilizer for the coffee shrubsgrowing beneath a canopy of trees. Unlike other methods, shade-grown coffee doesn't increase deforestation, and it protects habitats for animals likemigratory birds—which is why the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, which has developed its own coffee certification program,calls it ""bird-friendly.""But as with fair trade, there are costs associated with certification, and those costs are often passed on to consumers. Farmers or importers are left justifying the cost and wondering if the specialized label can attract a large enough market to validate their decision to certify. That said, many farmers who have the ability will do shade-grown regardless, since it's a better farming practice andsaves some costson fertilizer.In the end, all this information—or lack thereof—is a tool for consumers to use when making their coffee choices. Like any tool, sometimes it's helpful, and sometimes not. These labels might not make your decision any easier, and might drive you right back to your ""usual"" bag of beans—but at least your choice can be more nuanced.Provided byThe ConversationThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

The bag from your local roaster introduces you to La Familia Vieira of Huila, Colombia, who have worked ascoffee farmersfor four generations at 1,600 meters above sea level—about a mile.

Consumers are often asked to make more responsible choices. Yet when it comes to commodity goods like coffee, the complex production chain can turn an uncomplicated habit into a complicated decision.As a coffee enthusiast andmarketing professor who researches marketplace justice, I've long been fascinated with how ethics and coffee consumption are intertwined. Before COVID-19, my familyadopted a cat and named him Yukro, after a coffee-producing community in Ethiopia. While we were quarantining at home, I ordered Yukro-originating coffee from as many roasters as I could find to try to understand how consumers were supposed to make an informed choice.Paradoxically, the more information I gleaned, the less I knew how to make a responsible decision. Indeed, prior research has indicated thatinformation overload increases the paradox of choice; this is no different when factoring in ethical information. Additionally, as with a lot of consumer-facing information,it can be difficult to tell what information is relevant or credible.Marketers attempt to simplify this overload by using buzzwords that sound good but may not get across much nuance. However, you might consider some of these terms when trying to decide between ""100% Colombian"" and the Vieira family.Fair tradeAs a benchmark, the coffee industry typically uses the ""C-price"":the traded priceon the New York Intercontinental Exchange for a pound of coffee ready for export. ""Fair trade"" implies the coffee is fairly traded, often with the goal of paying farmers minimum prices—and fixed premiums—above the C-price.There are a few different fair trade certifications, such asFairtrade AmericaorFair Trade Certified. Each of these has its own, voluntary certification standards linked with the associated organization. Yetobtaining certificationcan come at significant additional cost for farms or importers.In contrast, some importers, or even roasters, have established relationships with specific farms, rather than buying beans at auction on the open market. These relationships potentially allow the importers to work directly with farmers over multi-year periods to improve the coffee quality and conditions.

Longer-term commitment can provide farmers more certainty in times when the C-price is below their cost of production.Yet these arrangements can be just as volatile for farmers if the importers they've committed to cannot find roasters interested in buying their beans—beans they could have sold at auction themselves.100% arabicaThere are several species of coffee, butapproximately 70% of the world's productioncomes from the arabica species, which grows well at higher altitudes. Like with wine, there are several varieties of arabica, and they tend to be a bit sweeter than other species—making arabica the ideal species for satisfying consumers.In other words, a label like ""100% arabica"" is meant to signal deliciousness and prestige—though it's about as descriptive as calling a bottle of pinot noir ""100% red.""When it comes to the environment, though, arabica isn't necessarily a win. Many arabica varieties are susceptible to climate change-related conditions such as coffee rust—a common fungusthat spreads easily and can devastate farms—or drought.Other coffee species such as robusta orthe less common eugenioidesare more climate-change resistant, reducing costs of production for farmers, and arecheaper on commodity markets. However, they have a bit of adifferent taste profilethan what folks are normally used to, which could mean lower earnings for farmers who make the switch, but could also provide new opportunities in areas where coffee was not previously farmed or to new markets of consumers' tastes.Single-originIf someone labeled a peach as ""American,"" a consumer would rightly wonder where exactly it came from. Similarly, ""single-origin"" is a very broad description that could mean the coffee came from ""Africa"" or ""Ethiopia"" or ""Jimma Zone""—even the zone's specific town of ""Agaro."" ""Single-estate"" at least gives slightly more farm-level information, though even this information may be tough to come by.Consumers have tended to want their coffee's journey from seed to cup to betraceable and transparent, which implies that everyone along the production chain is committed to equity—and ""single-origin"" appears to provide those qualities.As a result, some coffee marketers invest quite a bit in being able to craft a narrative that emotionally resonates with consumers and makes them feel ""connected"" to the farm. Others have developedblockchain solutionswhere each step along the coffee's journey, from bean to retail, is documented in a database that consumers can look at. Since blockchain data are immutable, the information a consumer gets from scanning a QR code on a label of a coffee bag should provide a clear chain of provenance.Shade-grownShade-grown labels indicate that farms have adopted a more environmentally sustainable method, using biomatter like dead leaves as natural fertilizer for the coffee shrubsgrowing beneath a canopy of trees. Unlike other methods, shade-grown coffee doesn't increase deforestation, and it protects habitats for animals likemigratory birds—which is why the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, which has developed its own coffee certification program,calls it ""bird-friendly.""But as with fair trade, there are costs associated with certification, and those costs are often passed on to consumers. Farmers or importers are left justifying the cost and wondering if the specialized label can attract a large enough market to validate their decision to certify. That said, many farmers who have the ability will do shade-grown regardless, since it's a better farming practice andsaves some costson fertilizer.In the end, all this information—or lack thereof—is a tool for consumers to use when making their coffee choices.

As a coffee enthusiast andmarketing professor who researches marketplace justice, I've long been fascinated with how ethics and coffee consumption are intertwined. Before COVID-19, my familyadopted a cat and named him Yukro, after a coffee-producing community in Ethiopia. While we were quarantining at home, I ordered Yukro-originating coffee from as many roasters as I could find to try to understand how consumers were supposed to make an informed choice.Paradoxically, the more information I gleaned, the less I knew how to make a responsible decision. Indeed, prior research has indicated thatinformation overload increases the paradox of choice; this is no different when factoring in ethical information. Additionally, as with a lot of consumer-facing information,it can be difficult to tell what information is relevant or credible.Marketers attempt to simplify this overload by using buzzwords that sound good but may not get across much nuance. However, you might consider some of these terms when trying to decide between ""100% Colombian"" and the Vieira family.Fair tradeAs a benchmark, the coffee industry typically uses the ""C-price"":the traded priceon the New York Intercontinental Exchange for a pound of coffee ready for export. ""Fair trade"" implies the coffee is fairly traded, often with the goal of paying farmers minimum prices—and fixed premiums—above the C-price.There are a few different fair trade certifications, such asFairtrade AmericaorFair Trade Certified. Each of these has its own, voluntary certification standards linked with the associated organization. Yetobtaining certificationcan come at significant additional cost for farms or importers.In contrast, some importers, or even roasters, have established relationships with specific farms, rather than buying beans at auction on the open market. These relationships potentially allow the importers to work directly with farmers over multi-year periods to improve the coffee quality and conditions.

Yet these arrangements can be just as volatile for farmers if the importers they've committed to cannot find roasters interested in buying their beans—beans they could have sold at auction themselves.100% arabicaThere are several species of coffee, butapproximately 70% of the world's productioncomes from the arabica species, which grows well at higher altitudes. Like with wine, there are several varieties of arabica, and they tend to be a bit sweeter than other species—making arabica the ideal species for satisfying consumers.In other words, a label like ""100% arabica"" is meant to signal deliciousness and prestige—though it's about as descriptive as calling a bottle of pinot noir ""100% red.""When it comes to the environment, though, arabica isn't necessarily a win. Many arabica varieties are susceptible to climate change-related conditions such as coffee rust—a common fungusthat spreads easily and can devastate farms—or drought.Other coffee species such as robusta orthe less common eugenioidesare more climate-change resistant, reducing costs of production for farmers, and arecheaper on commodity markets. However, they have a bit of adifferent taste profilethan what folks are normally used to, which could mean lower earnings for farmers who make the switch, but could also provide new opportunities in areas where coffee was not previously farmed or to new markets of consumers' tastes.Single-originIf someone labeled a peach as ""American,"" a consumer would rightly wonder where exactly it came from. Similarly, ""single-origin"" is a very broad description that could mean the coffee came from ""Africa"" or ""Ethiopia"" or ""Jimma Zone""—even the zone's specific town of ""Agaro."" ""Single-estate"" at least gives slightly more farm-level information, though even this information may be tough to come by.Consumers have tended to want their coffee's journey from seed to cup to betraceable and transparent, which implies that everyone along the production chain is committed to equity—and ""single-origin"" appears to provide those qualities.As a result, some coffee marketers invest quite a bit in being able to craft a narrative that emotionally resonates with consumers and makes them feel ""connected"" to the farm. Others have developedblockchain solutionswhere each step along the coffee's journey, from bean to retail, is documented in a database that consumers can look at. Since blockchain data are immutable, the information a consumer gets from scanning a QR code on a label of a coffee bag should provide a clear chain of provenance.Shade-grownShade-grown labels indicate that farms have adopted a more environmentally sustainable method, using biomatter like dead leaves as natural fertilizer for the coffee shrubsgrowing beneath a canopy of trees. Unlike other methods, shade-grown coffee doesn't increase deforestation, and it protects habitats for animals likemigratory birds—which is why the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, which has developed its own coffee certification program,calls it ""bird-friendly.""But as with fair trade, there are costs associated with certification, and those costs are often passed on to consumers. Farmers or importers are left justifying the cost and wondering if the specialized label can attract a large enough market to validate their decision to certify. That said, many farmers who have the ability will do shade-grown regardless, since it's a better farming practice andsaves some costson fertilizer.In the end, all this information—or lack thereof—is a tool for consumers to use when making their coffee choices. Like any tool, sometimes it's helpful, and sometimes not. These labels might not make your decision any easier, and might drive you right back to your ""usual"" bag of beans—but at least your choice can be more nuanced.Provided byThe ConversationThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

In an interview with TASS, the official stated that as many as 300 Russian athletes could take part in the Games next year under a neutral flag. “We hope that the Paralympic federations will allow our athletes to participate in competitions so that they can be selected. The criteria already exist in general terms, the (International Paralympic Committee) executive committee will formulate all this more clearly in the near future,”Rozhkov said. However, the RPC president stressed that no Russian athletes will participate at the Paris Paralympics if they have to sign political statements to be cleared to compete. “The question of declarations has not been discussed,”said Rozhkov, although he noted that a number of Olympic federations that hold Paralympic competitions have previously demanded that Russian athletes sign declarations condemning Moscow’s military campaign against Ukraine.“If this happens, our athletes will not go anywhere,”Rozhkov insisted. Russian athletes were due to take part at the Winter Paralympic Games in Beijing last year, but were banned in a last-minute reversal by the IPC because of the Ukraine conflict. The IPC later voted to suspend the RPC’s membership, although that decision was overturned in May after Russia successfully appealed. A tribunal of three judges found that the IPC had imposed the suspension with“procedural violations”and without producing any evidence of wrongdoing by the RPC. On Friday, the IPC Extraordinary General Assembly in Bahrain voted once again to suspend Russia, but allowed Russian athletes to participate in international competitions, including the Paralympic Games in Paris, under neutral status. The 2024 Paralympic Games are set to be held in Paris from August 28 to September 8. ",en

Thames Valley Police is taking a fresh look at harassment and stalking allegations previously made by a woman against Brand between 2018 and 2022, the BBC and PA news agency said. The police force declined to name Brand — as is usual in the U.K. for people who have not been charged — but issued a statement when asked about the news reports. “Thames Valley Police in the past two weeks, received new information in relation to harassment and stalking allegations dating back to 2018,"" it said. ""This information is being investigated; as such it would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing investigation.” London's Metropolitan Police said last week it was examining “a number of allegations of sexual offenses” relating to Brand following a television documentary and newspaper investigations. Brand, 48, denies allegations ofsexual assaultmade by four women in a Channel 4 television documentary and The Times and Sunday Times newspapers. The accusers, who have not been named, include one who said she was sexually assaulted during a relationship with him when she was 16. Another woman says Brand raped her in Los Angeles in 2012. Brand was a major U.K. star in the early 2000s, hosting shows on radio and television and appearing in several Hollywood movies. He was briefly married to pop star Katy Perry between 2010 and 2012. Brand has largely disappeared from mainstream media but has built up a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories.YouTubehas said it will stop Brand from making money from the streaming site, where he has 6.6 million subscribers, due to the “serious allegations” against him.",en

Meanwhile, swarms of protesters are filling the streets of the Armenian capital of Yerevan, demanding the prime minister's ousting. And relations with Russia, an old ally and protector, have frayed amid mutual accusations. Armenia now finds itself facing multiple challenges after being thrust into one of the worst political crises in its decades of independence following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Developments unfolded with surprising speed after Azerbaijan waged a lightning military campaign in Nagorno-Karabakh, a majority ethnic Armenian region that has run its affairs for three decades without international recognition. That triggered a massive exodus by the ethnic Armenians who feared living under Azerbaijani rule. More than 80% of the region’s 120,000 residents hastily packed their belongings and trudged in a gruelling and slow journey over the single mountain road into impoverished Armenia, which is struggling to accommodate them. “There’s a tremendous amount of anger and frustration directed at Nikol Pashinyan,” said Laurence Broers, an expert on the region at Chatham House. Pashinyan’s economically challenged government has to provide them quickly with housing, medical care and jobs. While the global Armenian diaspora has pledged to help, it poses major financial and logistical problems for the landlocked country. Thomas de Waal, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Europe think tank, agrees with other observers that one factor in Pashinyan’s favour is that whatever simmering anger there is against him, there is just as much directed toward Russia, Armenia’s main ally. After a six-week war in 2020 that saw Azerbaijan reclaim part of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding territories, Russia sent about 2,000 peacekeeping troops to the region under a Kremlin-brokered truce. Pashinyan has accused the peacekeepers of failing to prevent the recent hostilities by Azerbaijan. Russia has been distracted by its war in Ukraine, which has eroded its influence in the region and made the Kremlin reluctant to defy Azerbaijan and its main ally Turkey, a key economic partner for Moscow amid Western sanctions. “Clearly, this Azerbaijani military operation would not have been possible if the Russian peacekeepers had tried to keep the peace, but they just basically stood down,” de Waal said. The Kremlin, in turn, has sought to shift the blame to Pashinyan, accusing him of precipitating the fall of Nagorno-Karabakh by acknowledging Azerbaijan's sovereignty over the region and damaging Armenia's ties with Russia by embracing the West. Russian President Vladimir Putin has long been suspicious of Pashinyan, a former journalist who came to power in 2018 after leading protests that ousted the previous government. Even before Azerbaijan’s operation to reclaim control of Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia had vented anger at Armenia for hosting US troops for joint military drills and moving to recognise the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court after it had indicted Putin for war crimes connected to the deportation of children from Ukraine. The bad feelings escalated after the fall of Nagorno-Karabakh, with Moscow assailing Pashinyan in harsh language that hadn't been heard before. The Russian Foreign Ministry blasted “the inconsistent stance of the Armenian leadership, which flip-flopped on policy and sought Western support over working closely with Russia and Azerbaijan.” It remains unclear whether Pashinyan might take Armenia out of the Moscow-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organization, a group of several former Soviet nations, and other Russia-led alliances. Armenia also hosts a Russian military base and Russian border guards help patrol Armenia’s frontier with Turkey. Despite the worsening rift, Pashinyan has refrained from threats to rupture links with Moscow, but he emphasised the need to bolster security and other ties with the West. Even though the Russian peacekeepers didn’t try to prevent Azerbaijan from reclaiming Nagorno-Karabakh, the troops' presence in Armenia helps counter potential moves by Azerbaijan and Turkey to pressure Yerevan on some contested issues.   Baku has long demanded that Armenia offer a corridor to Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan, which is separated from the rest of the country by a 40-kilometre (25-mile) swathe of Armenian territory. The deal that ended the 2020 war envisaged reopening rail and road links to Nakhchivan that have been cut since the start of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but their restoration has stalled amid continuing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has warned it could use force to secure the corridor if Armenia keeps stonewalling the issue, and there have been fears in Armenia that the corridor could infringe on its sovereignty. “I think there is extreme concern about this in Armenia, given the very dramatic military asymmetry between Armenia and Azerbaijan today and given the fact that Russia has ostensibly abdicated its role as a security guarantor for Armenia,” Broers said. Despite Western calls for Azerbaijan to respect Armenia’s sovereignty as well as strong signals from Iran, which also has warned Azerbaijan not to use force against Armenia, tensions remain high, he noted. “The issue is to what extent Azerbaijan and Turkey, backed maybe quietly by Russia, push this issue,"" de Waal said. ""Do they just sort of try and force Armenia at the negotiating table or do they actually start to use force to try and get what they want? This is the scenario everyone fears.”",en

The Guinness World Record for oldest skydiver was set in May 2022 by 103-year-old Linnéa Ingegärd Larsson from Sweden. But Skydive Chicago is working to have Guinness World Records certify Hoffner's jump as a record, WLS-TV reported. Hoffner first skydived when she was 100. On Sunday, she left her walker behind just short of the plane — a Skyvan — and was helped up the steps to join the others waiting inside to skydive. “Let’s go, let’s go, Geronimo!” Hoffner said after she was finally seated. When she first skydived, she said she had to be pushed out of the aircraft. But on Sunday, tethered to a U.S. Parachute Association-certified instructor, Hoffner insisted on leading the jump from 13,500 feet (4,100 meters). She looked calm and confident when the plane was aloft and its aft door opened to reveal tan crop fields far below shortly before she shuffled toward the edge and leaped into the air. She tumbled out of the plane, head first, completing a perfect forward roll in the sky, before flying stable in freefall with her belly facing the ground. The dive lasted seven minutes, including her parachute's slow descent to the ground. Coming in to land, the wind pushed Hoffner's white hair back, she clung to the harness over her narrow shoulders, picked up her legs and plopped softly onto the grassy landing area. Friends rushed in to share congratulations, while someone brought over Hoffner’s red walker. She rose quickly and she was asked how it felt to be back on the ground. “Wonderful,” Hoffner said. “But it was wonderful up there. The whole thing was delightful, wonderful, couldn’t have been better."" After her jump, Hoffner's mind quickly turned to the future and other challenges. The lifelong Chicago woman, who's set to turn 105 in December, said she might take a ride in a hot-air balloon next. “I’ve never been in one of those,” she said.",en

But if it is true, it would be a welcome step,” said US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. “We remain concerned by the cycle of increasing tensions and sporadic violence in northern Kosovo and we encourage both parties to resume the dialogue facilitated by the European Union,” he added. Serbia refuses to recognise the independence of Kosovo, its former southern province.  Rebels from Kosovo's Albanian majority fought a war for independence against Serbian forces between 1998 and 1999 that ended following a NATO bombing campaign. Tensions have spiked in northern Kosovo, home to approximately 120,000 Kosovo Serbs. On 24 September, a Kosovar Albanian police officer was killed in an ambush in an area where Serbs are the majority in several towns.  A shootout ensued, between Kosovar special forces and a heavily armed unit of Kosovo Serbs. Three of them were killed, while three others were arrested. Others fled.  According to Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti, this incident - one of the most serious escalations to occur in Kosovo in recent years - was part of a ""larger plan to annex northern Kosovo through a coordinated attack"" on scores of positions.  On Monday, he claimed the plan was to ""set up a corridor towards Serbia "" to ""allow the supply of weapons and troops."" Also on Monday, Serbian leaders announced they reduced the number of troops along the Kosovar border, which they called an ""administrative line"".  The Serbian army has reduced its contingent of soldiers from 8,350 to 4,500, said Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Milan Mojsilovic, three days after the US warned against a “major military deployment”. On Sunday, NATO announced it would strengthen its presence in Kosovo with 600 British soldiers.  Its peacekeeping force - known as KFOR - is comprised of around 4,500 soldiers from 27 countries. The US-led military alliance again called for calm on Sunday and demanded that Belgrade and Pristina return to dialogue as quickly as possible.  This is ""the only way to achieve lasting peace"", according to a NATO spokesperson. During the latest outbreak of violence in the region on 24 September, a paramilitary unit composed of several dozen men killed a Kosovar Albanian policeman and injured another at a checkpoint near the village of Banjska, in northern Kosovo.  Supported by Belgrade, they reject the government in Pristina.  On the same day of the attack, Kosovar authorities claimed Serbia was behind the heavily armed group - something Serbian authorities rejected. The US, Kosovo's main international ally, urged Serbia to ""withdraw [its] troops"" from the border on Friday.  Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic accused Washington of lying, without explicitly denying the presence of Serbian soldiers.  He said the number of Serbian troops was well below that during a similar deployment in May. General Mojsilovic claimed he was ""surprised"" by the ""deep concern of some"" about the deployment of Serbian forces during this latest ""security crisis"". According to him, the Serbian army had deployed some ""14,000 soldiers"" in the same region between December 2022 and May 2023 during “similar security crises”.  Serbian forces had then been placed ""at the highest level of alert"", which was not the case last week, Mojsilovic stressed.",en

The pioneering doctor, who on Monday announced he would run for president, is best known for founding the Panzi hospital and foundation in conflict-torn eastern Democratic Republic of Congo DRC) after witnessing the horrific injuries and diseases suffered by rape survivors. In 2018, he was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Yazidi activist Nadia Murad for efforts to end sexual violence as a weapon of war. At the time, Mukwege was one of the leading critics of then-Congolese president Joseph Kabila, who lost an election after 18 years in office that year, and ceded power to incumbent President Felix Tshisekedi. But the doctor has remained as critical of the new government as he was of the last. ""We condemn the liberticidal drift of the regime"", the 68-year-old posted on social media in early July, condemning the detention of a member of the political opposition. A family man with five children, Mukwege is also well known for speaking out about the conflict in eastern Congo, a mineral-rich region where militias have wreaked havoc for three decades. One such militia, the M23, has captured swathes of territory since late 2021 and pushed over one million people from their homes. Mukwege has blasted the government's decision to invite East African countries to deploy troops the defeat the rebels. On June 30, on the anniversary of the DRC's independence from Belgium, he said his native country was still not truly sovereign and called for a ""democratic revolution"" to spur new leadership. The son of a Pentecostal pastor, Mukwege was born in 1955 in the then-Belgian Congo, and studied medicine in neighbouring Burundi. After his studies, he returned home to work at Lemera hospital, in eastern Congo's South Kivu province, where he encountered women suffering from genital lesions. Mukwege subsequently left to specialise in gynaecology and obstetrics in Angers, France. He returned to Lemera in 1989 to run the gynaecology department and stayed as the First Congo War broke out in 1996. The war devastated the hospital, however. In 1999, Mukwege set up the Panzi hospital in South Kivu's capital Bukavu. Initially designed as a maternity facility, the hospital became a rape clinic as the surrounding region descended into the Second Congo War, which was marked by severe sexual violence. Mukwege has recounted how the hospital's first patient was a rape victim who had been shot in her genitals. He earned the epithet 'the man who mends women' from the title of an acclaimed 2015 film about his work. He says the war on women's bodies is still raging in the DRC. The regional wars that devastated the country in the 1990s and 2000s have ended, but brutal militias continue to plague the east. Mukwege's tireless advocacy has landed him in trouble on several occasions. In 2012, he escaped an assassination attempt. And he currently lives under protection of UN peacekeepers at his Panzi foundation, when he isn't giving lectures abroad. The doctor has also found himself at the centre of tensions between the DRC and Rwanda. In 2021, Rwanda's President Paul Kagame denied that his country's troops committed crimes during their involvement in the regional wars of the 1990s -- and implied that Mukwege was part of an anti-Rwanda conspiracy. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi hit back: Mukwege is a ""figure of national pride,"" he said, adding that the Nobel laureate had ""all of our support"".",en

When Via and his wife A… [+11299 chars]",Climate,"Jake Via, a 39-year-old who has lived everywhere from Brazil and Seattle to Sun Valley, Idaho, and Austin, Texas, calls Milwaukee “the greatest city on earth.” And he’s serious.When Via and his wife Anabel planned to relocate from Salt Lake City in 2021, they made an extensive list of cities, and they are grateful that they ended up in Milwaukee instead of other cities they considered like Charlotte, Pittsburgh, or Phoenix, where his parents live. One reason is that Via says his “climate anxiety” has been growing while he’s lived in the American West, in cities running out of water and whose air is frequently polluted by wildfire smoke or smog. When an earthquake struck Salt Lake City in March of 2020, Via and his wife, who grew up in Mexico City, decided they’d had enough, and embarked on a search for a place to settle where they wouldn’t have to worry about water or earthquakes or fires. Milwaukee ranked highly because it’s relatively immune to natural disasters, has access to a huge body of freshwater—Lake Michigan—has affordable houses for sale, and is diverse, which was important to the mixed-race couple. Now that they've moved, Via loves not having to worry about running out of water, not having to water his lawn because of Milwaukee's frequent rains, and being able to keep his window open for a good chunk of the year because he doesn't need air conditioning. Via knows most people still aren’t considering the climate when they move—states beset with blistering heat and hurricanes like Arizona and Florida are still gaining population, fast. But “I can’t wrap my head around not considering factors like, is there going to be water to drink in 30 years,” he says. “Or what’s going to be the average outdoor temperature? Or is the local government making the changes needed to protect the things needed for human life?” For decades, the Midwest has been a region left behind as manufacturing and other jobs dried up. Milwaukee County’s population has shrunk 12.3% in the last 50 years. Illinois has lost more than 2 million people since 2009. And while sunbelt states like Florida and Texas grew between 2020 and 2022, Illinois, Michigan and Ohioall lost population, according to the Council of State Governments. But some Midwestern leaders see their resilience to climate change as one means of reversing this decline. They’re putting their immunity from severe weather front and center, investing in making their cities more sustainable, and not shying away from the idea they can attract new residents like Via who are concerned about the climate. “As the climate continues to change and people make decisions about where they will move as individuals or where they will relocate or start businesses, folks will consider—do we want do it in a place that’s more likely to see intense hurricanes and storms year over year, a place that has earthquakes constantly, a place where it is unbearable to go outside for weeks or months?” Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson says. “Or do they want to do it in a place that’s more insulated from these things, like Milwaukee.” Similarly, the Citizens’ Research Council, a public policy group in Michigan, recently published areportsuggesting that climate migrants were one potential solution to the state’s declining population. Though Michigan has not historically prioritized its environment, the group argues, instead of putting industry first, focusing on natural resources could attract new residents and investments. Luring people to the Midwest will be a tall order—the region has been losing population for decades for reasons that are not changing overnight, including cold winters, lack of good jobs, and, in some states,high taxes. Leaders selling their locations as a safe place from climate change may not sway many people who are just looking for a warm and affordable place to live;86% of the 50 zip codesthat have seen the largest increase in new residents since 2020 were in Texas, Florida, and Arizona. Still, just about every list of the “best cities for climate change” include many Midwestern cities;Architectural Digesthas Milwaukee and Columbus, Ohio, in its top 10; Policygenius, an insurance platform, has Milwaukee, Columbus, and Minneapolis onits list. The top 10 list put together by Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Tulane University, almost exclusively consists of Midwest and Rust Belt cities, including Detroit, Duluth, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Buffalo, and Rochester in New York.  Those aren’t the only cities that will benefit, Keenan says; many other places are benefiting from a change in preferences “but in general, people will be moving north and east.” Of course, climate change is not the only reason people pick where to live—people also seekjob opportunitiesand more affordable housing. Today, many young people are also looking for places that are affordable and that have embraced the kind of urban planning that makes it easy to walk or bike around town, says Keenan. Minneapolis, for instance, has transit-oriented development and mixed-income housing. East Lansing, Mich., has urban density, which is more climate-friendly than places where you have to get in your car to go anywhere. “A lot of these things were done in the name of sustainability and better urban planning and mitigating carbon footprint, but they’ve also been financially successful” in that they attracted new businesses and residents, he says. But climate change is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, according to the Site Selectors Guild, an association for consultants who help companies choose where to locate. Though factors like workforce availability and risk management are currently high among reasons that companies choose a certain place to locate, site selectors surveyed said that climate change, environment and sustainability would be the top motivator by 2032, according to theState of Site Selection 2022. Midwestern cities and states that have long seen nothing but people leaving are seizing on the opportunity to try and attract new residents and businesses. “Businesses in the Milwaukee region face a low risk of natural disasters, decreasing the risk to people and buildings,” bragsChoose Milwaukee, a website trying to attract businesses to the region sponsored by a regional economic development group. Buffalo will be “a climate refuge,” Buffalo Mayor Byron W. Brown said in his 2019 State of the City address; the city has since appointed aclimate action managerto lessen the city’s carbon footprint and prepare it for climate change. Michigan’s economic development website makes no secret that the state is “Ranked No. 1 Best for Climate Change” Milwaukee has portrayed itself as free from natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes, including on a PowerPoint it shows businesses considering relocating there, says Jim Paetsch, executive director of Milwaukee 7, the economic development group. It used to be that people would laugh when they saw the slide and ask why he didn’t include locusts or other Biblical plagues. “Nobody laughs anymore,” he says. Read More:Where We'll End Up Living as the Planet Burns Indeed, the first GOP debate was held in Milwaukee, and the party also chose the city for its nominating convention in 2024—Mayor Johnson says the city reminded the GOP that having a convention in Florida in the summer would be extremely hot and sticky, a strategy that appears to have worked. The 2020 Democratic National Convention was also held in Milwaukee. The signs these campaigns are working are currently more anecdotal than anything else. Johnson, the Milwaukee mayor, says he often hears from local real estate agents that many of their clientele have relocated from the west or places more prone to natural disasters. Intel chose the Columbus, Ohio region in January 2022 to invest $20 billion on at leasttwo leading-edge chip facilitiesto onshore production; the company will become the area’slargest water user.The number of data centers—the huge buildings housing servers and help keep the Internet running—has been growing more quickly in the Midwest because of the relatively low cost of real estate, availability of power, and low level of risk from natural disasters, says John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research Group. Population-wise, all that can really be said is that population losses are slowing in some Midwestern cities, including Milwaukee and Toledo, Ohio; some Midwestern cities, including Duluth, Minn., and Columbus, added population between July 2021 and 2022, according to data compiled by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. “The pandemic had a huge impact on migration patterns and the 2021-2022 data provide a hint of where and how revival will occur,” he says. Weather and affordability played a big role in Dianne Minardi and Dan Constable’s decision to move to Milwaukee from Atlanta. The couple, who both work remotely in higher education, had lived in Las Cruces, N.M., where it got so hot they would have to wake up at 6 am to walk their dog, and where there was always a fear of running out of water. When they moved to Atlanta, they thought they might stay there, but they quickly realized that they were nearly priced out of the  market. Minardi also didn’t love the humidity and heat. “I just wanted to move somewhere where I can afford to live and the temperature is not going to force me to move again in my lifetime,” she says. Since they are both from Ohio, they looked into the Midwest and wanted a walkable city where they could have a lot of space to garden. A friend told them about Milwaukee and they bought a house over FaceTime, never having visited the city. They moved in January 2023 and love their house and neighborhood, a few short blocks from Lake Michigan, as well as the food scene and general friendliness of the city. Minardi says she’s glad they bought when they did. “My biggest concern was that everyone would move here and it would get too expensive for us to,” she says. For many Midwestern leaders, the hint of some reversal of population decline is enough to suggest that they need to invest more in sustainability, walkability, and the type of projects that will attract new residents. Milwaukee’s Mayor Johnson, for instance, wants to build a protected bike lane network across the city. Michigan’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmerhas unveiled plansto make Michigan generate all of its electricity from solar, wind, and other carbon-free sources by 2035. “I don’t think we can just say, as a state, ‘The south is going to boil and we can just rest and people will come here,’” Eric Lupher, president of the Citizens Research Council of Michigan. “We have to get the rest of our ducks in a row, so to speak, try to be better at trying to attract more companies.” Indeed, for Via and some other Midwestern migrants, the fact that some Midwestern local governments appear invested in preparing for climate change is appealing. Milwaukee is trying to remove highways and make its downtown more walkable, he says, while places like Salt Lake City and Phoenix seem to be ignoring the challenges that lay ahead. “I was tired of living in places that made sense when there was 100,000 people living there but that no longer made sense when there were millions of people—and nobody talking about it or doing anything about it.”",en

Kyiv brushed off the wobbles on both sides of the Atlantic, especially the prospect that the US Congressional vote, whichexcluded aid to Ukraine from an emergency Billto prevent a government shutdown, represented a deeper change in policy. ""We don't feel that the US support has been shattered ... because the United States understands that what is at stake in Ukraine is much bigger than just Ukraine,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters as he greeted the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. As for the election victory of pro-Russian Slovakian former Prime Minister Robert Fico, Kuleba said it was ""too early to judge"" the impact on politics there, noting that a new leader would still have to form a coalition. Monday's meeting in Kyiv was touted by Borrell as a historic first but it comes at an awkward time for the Western alliance that has supported Kyiv. The summer is ending after a slower-than-expected Ukrainian military counter-offensive, without the major success that Western leaders had hoped to see before autumn mud clogs the treads of their donated tanks. ""I am sure that Ukraine and the entire free world are capable of winning this confrontation. But our victory depends directly on our cooperation with you,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the ministers, according to his website. Borrell told a news briefing with Kuleba the EU remained united in its support for Ukraine and that he had proposedan EU spending package for Kyivof up to 5 billion euros (US$5.25 billion) for 2024 which he hoped to have agreed by then. Kuleba said it would help both Ukraine and the EU to have more clarity on the judicial aspects of transferring Russian assets frozen in the West to help fund Ukraine's reconstruction efforts. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for efforts to prepare Ukraine for the coming winter, including through air defence and guaranteed energy supplies, after Russia bombed Ukraine's energy infrastructure last year. ""Last winter, we saw the brutal way in which the Russian president is waging this war,"" said Baerbock. ""We must prevent this together with everything we have, as far as possible.""",en

She is currently a deputy project scientist on the New Horizons Kuiper Belt Extended Mission.Q. What is important about the OSIRIS-REx mission?For the United States, this is the first mission that has gone to an asteroid and returned samples from the surface after touching it. Japan has done this before—returned samples from a similar asteroid called Ryugu, very much like Bennu.Getting samples from an asteroid provides real ground truth. We say that there's a connection between meteorites we find on Earth and asteroids. That helps us make connections between the compositions that you measure with the actual rock that you're holding in your hand and ground-based astronomy, where you look through a telescope at an asteroid and use a spectrometer and measure absorptions by different minerals and molecules on the surface to measure its surface composition.And it's also a way to get below the surface. You can't do that with ground-based astronomy. You're just looking at the surface.Q. What is in the samples?Essentially, rock samples, but ranging widely in size. Some so small you would consider it dust, but also actual rock chunks, a few centimeters or so in size that you could hold in your hand—the whole range. And how much material was brought back? That's to be determined. The spacecraft did do a guess measurement of how much sample it got, but it wasn't very exact. It's likely to be in the range of 250 grams to as much as 600 grams, roughly 8 to 21 ounces.Q. What is it that the scientists hope to learn from this material?The connections that they want to make are to measure the actual composition of bodies that formed early in the solar system's history and haven't been modified all that much. Or you can tell how much modification there was. This will help us learn more about the origin of the solar system and how the asteroids were put together.Q. How big is Bennu, and how old is it?Bennu is about 1,600 feet in diameter, standing a bit taller than the Empire State Building. Bennu's age is commensurate with the age of thesolar system, 4.5 billion years, and that's why it's of interest, because it formed so long ago. The oldest rocks on Earth are about 4 billion years old.Q. How long will it take to analyze the Bennu material?The sample container was flown to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where the Astromaterials Curation Site is located. That's where all the moon rocks went after the Apollo missions and meteorites collected here on Earth are sent for analysis. They have the proper equipment and clean rooms there.They're going to do that very carefully. There are several layers protecting both the samples from any kind of contamination we could give it and then back the other way to contamination from the samples for any humans. They're going to take the time to do the careful, thorough analysis.Q. What do they hope to find in the samples?The primary analysis will be composition, measuring what those rocks are made of and if there are any unique isotopes and minerals. We've been looking at this object and we've had close-up views of it from the spacecraft for years now, so we know generally what the surface is made of. But there are limits to remote sensing, without touching it and analyzing it. Now you have real samples that you can cut in half and see what they look like inside. You can't do that with just a telescope looking at an object in space. We slice meteorites open all the time and measure their elemental composition and crystal structures inside the object. They'll be cutting these rocks up.Q. How big is the OSIRIS-REx explorer and what happens to it now?OSIRIS-REx is 8 by 8 by 10 feet, a little bit bigger than a grand piano. The spacecraft itself came close to Earth on Sunday morning and jettisoned a landing craft, and had to do that very carefully because you have to enter the Earth's atmosphere at just the right angle. If you come in too shallow, you'll just bounce off the atmosphere. If you come in too steep, you'll burn up. You have to get the angle just right.The spacecraft itself, the OSIRIS-REx, has now got a new purpose. OSIRIS-APEX is the name of the new mission, and it's heading to another asteroid called Apophis. So it's got a whole new purpose in life, having an encounter with another asteroid. It won't be taking a sample because it only had one sample collector, but it will try to dislodge dust and tiny rocks on the surface of Apophis by firing the spacecraft's gas thrusters at it.Q. What information is it supposed to send back about Apophis?OSIRIS-APEX will go into orbit around Apophis in 2029, flying with the asteroid for 18 months, just after the asteroid's close fly-by past the Earth. Just like OSIRIS-REx did with Bennu, OSIRIS-APEX will take close-up pictures of Apophis and measure its surface composition using its on-board spectrometers.Q. Are there other missions to study other asteroids?This fall is quite a busy time for asteroid science at NASThe Psyche spacecraft is scheduled to launch around Oct. 12 from Kennedy Space Center, starting a six-year journey to the asteroid Psyche. Psyche is a unique asteroid because it is metal-rich. Originally, it was thought to be the remnant metal core of a larger asteroid, but I think now the consensus is that it's not a remnant core. There are silicates on the surface in addition to iron and nickel, but still the metal content is very high in this particular asteroid.Another asteroid mission called Lucy, launched in 2021, will have its first close flyby on Nov. 1 when it will encounter the asteroid Dinkinesh. The Dinkinesh flyby will serve as a test for the upcoming flybys of Lucy's primary targets, six of the Trojan asteroids located in Jupiter's orbit. Lucy got its name from the hominid fossil called Lucy that was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974.Provided byUniversity of VirginiaCitation:

											 part may be reproduced without the written permission. The content is provided for information purposes only. The event ended a seven-year mission for the spacecraft, also known as the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resources Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer.UVA Today checked in with Anne Verbiscer, a research professor in the University of Virginia's Department of Astronomy, to learn more about the mission and why it is important.Verbiscer specializes in the structure and composition of surfaces in the outer solar system and has been a member of three different NASA spacecraft mission teams: Voyager, Cassini and New Horizons. She is currently a deputy project scientist on the New Horizons Kuiper Belt Extended Mission.Q. What is important about the OSIRIS-REx mission?For the United States, this is the first mission that has gone to an asteroid and returned samples from the surface after touching it. Japan has done this before—returned samples from a similar asteroid called Ryugu, very much like Bennu.Getting samples from an asteroid provides real ground truth. We say that there's a connection between meteorites we find on Earth and asteroids. That helps us make connections between the compositions that you measure with the actual rock that you're holding in your hand and ground-based astronomy, where you look through a telescope at an asteroid and use a spectrometer and measure absorptions by different minerals and molecules on the surface to measure its surface composition.And it's also a way to get below the surface. You can't do that with ground-based astronomy. You're just looking at the surface.Q. What is in the samples?Essentially, rock samples, but ranging widely in size. Some so small you would consider it dust, but also actual rock chunks, a few centimeters or so in size that you could hold in your hand—the whole range. And how much material was brought back? That's to be determined. The spacecraft did do a guess measurement of how much sample it got, but it wasn't very exact. It's likely to be in the range of 250 grams to as much as 600 grams, roughly 8 to 21 ounces.Q. What is it that the scientists hope to learn from this material?The connections that they want to make are to measure the actual composition of bodies that formed early in the solar system's history and haven't been modified all that much. Or you can tell how much modification there was. This will help us learn more about the origin of the solar system and how the asteroids were put together.Q. How big is Bennu, and how old is it?Bennu is about 1,600 feet in diameter, standing a bit taller than the Empire State Building. Bennu's age is commensurate with the age of thesolar system, 4.5 billion years, and that's why it's of interest, because it formed so long ago. The oldest rocks on Earth are about 4 billion years old.Q. How long will it take to analyze the Bennu material?The sample container was flown to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where the Astromaterials Curation Site is located. That's where all the moon rocks went after the Apollo missions and meteorites collected here on Earth are sent for analysis. They have the proper equipment and clean rooms there.They're going to do that very carefully. There are several layers protecting both the samples from any kind of contamination we could give it and then back the other way to contamination from the samples for any humans. They're going to take the time to do the careful, thorough analysis.Q. What do they hope to find in the samples?The primary analysis will be composition, measuring what those rocks are made of and if there are any unique isotopes and minerals. We've been looking at this object and we've had close-up views of it from the spacecraft for years now, so we know generally what the surface is made of. But there are limits to remote sensing, without touching it and analyzing it. Now you have real samples that you can cut in half and see what they look like inside. You can't do that with just a telescope looking at an object in space. We slice meteorites open all the time and measure their elemental composition and crystal structures inside the object. They'll be cutting these rocks up.Q. How big is the OSIRIS-REx explorer and what happens to it now?OSIRIS-REx is 8 by 8 by 10 feet, a little bit bigger than a grand piano.

What information is it supposed to send back about Apophis?OSIRIS-APEX will go into orbit around Apophis in 2029, flying with the asteroid for 18 months, just after the asteroid's close fly-by past the Earth. Just like OSIRIS-REx did with Bennu, OSIRIS-APEX will take close-up pictures of Apophis and measure its surface composition using its on-board spectrometers.Q. Are there other missions to study other asteroids?This fall is quite a busy time for asteroid science at NASThe Psyche spacecraft is scheduled to launch around Oct. 12 from Kennedy Space Center, starting a six-year journey to the asteroid Psyche. Psyche is a unique asteroid because it is metal-rich. Originally, it was thought to be the remnant metal core of a larger asteroid, but I think now the consensus is that it's not a remnant core. There are silicates on the surface in addition to iron and nickel, but still the metal content is very high in this particular asteroid.Another asteroid mission called Lucy, launched in 2021, will have its first close flyby on Nov. 1 when it will encounter the asteroid Dinkinesh. The Dinkinesh flyby will serve as a test for the upcoming flybys of Lucy's primary targets, six of the Trojan asteroids located in Jupiter's orbit. Lucy got its name from the hominid fossil called Lucy that was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974.Provided byUniversity of VirginiaCitation:

We say that there's a connection between meteorites we find on Earth and asteroids. That helps us make connections between the compositions that you measure with the actual rock that you're holding in your hand and ground-based astronomy, where you look through a telescope at an asteroid and use a spectrometer and measure absorptions by different minerals and molecules on the surface to measure its surface composition.And it's also a way to get below the surface. You can't do that with ground-based astronomy. You're just looking at the surface.Q. What is in the samples?Essentially, rock samples, but ranging widely in size. Some so small you would consider it dust, but also actual rock chunks, a few centimeters or so in size that you could hold in your hand—the whole range. And how much material was brought back? That's to be determined. The spacecraft did do a guess measurement of how much sample it got, but it wasn't very exact. It's likely to be in the range of 250 grams to as much as 600 grams, roughly 8 to 21 ounces.Q. What is it that the scientists hope to learn from this material?The connections that they want to make are to measure the actual composition of bodies that formed early in the solar system's history and haven't been modified all that much. Or you can tell how much modification there was. This will help us learn more about the origin of the solar system and how the asteroids were put together.Q. How big is Bennu, and how old is it?Bennu is about 1,600 feet in diameter, standing a bit taller than the Empire State Building. Bennu's age is commensurate with the age of thesolar system, 4.5 billion years, and that's why it's of interest, because it formed so long ago. The oldest rocks on Earth are about 4 billion years old.Q. How long will it take to analyze the Bennu material?The sample container was flown to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where the Astromaterials Curation Site is located. That's where all the moon rocks went after the Apollo missions and meteorites collected here on Earth are sent for analysis. They have the proper equipment and clean rooms there.They're going to do that very carefully. There are several layers protecting both the samples from any kind of contamination we could give it and then back the other way to contamination from the samples for any humans. They're going to take the time to do the careful, thorough analysis.Q. What do they hope to find in the samples?The primary analysis will be composition, measuring what those rocks are made of and if there are any unique isotopes and minerals. We've been looking at this object and we've had close-up views of it from the spacecraft for years now, so we know generally what the surface is made of. But there are limits to remote sensing, without touching it and analyzing it. Now you have real samples that you can cut in half and see what they look like inside. You can't do that with just a telescope looking at an object in space. We slice meteorites open all the time and measure their elemental composition and crystal structures inside the object. They'll be cutting these rocks up.Q. How big is the OSIRIS-REx explorer and what happens to it now?OSIRIS-REx is 8 by 8 by 10 feet, a little bit bigger than a grand piano. The spacecraft itself came close to Earth on Sunday morning and jettisoned a landing craft, and had to do that very carefully because you have to enter the Earth's atmosphere at just the right angle. If you come in too shallow, you'll just bounce off the atmosphere. If you come in too steep, you'll burn up. You have to get the angle just right.The spacecraft itself, the OSIRIS-REx, has now got a new purpose. OSIRIS-APEX is the name of the new mission, and it's heading to another asteroid called Apophis. So it's got a whole new purpose in life, having an encounter with another asteroid.

The primary analysis will be composition, measuring what those rocks are made of and if there are any unique isotopes and minerals. We've been looking at this object and we've had close-up views of it from the spacecraft for years now, so we know generally what the surface is made of. But there are limits to remote sensing, without touching it and analyzing it. Now you have real samples that you can cut in half and see what they look like inside. You can't do that with just a telescope looking at an object in space. We slice meteorites open all the time and measure their elemental composition and crystal structures inside the object. They'll be cutting these rocks up.Q. How big is the OSIRIS-REx explorer and what happens to it now?OSIRIS-REx is 8 by 8 by 10 feet, a little bit bigger than a grand piano.

The Western Hemisphere's poorest nation has been in freefall, with armed gangs taking over parts of the country and unleashing brutal violence and the economy and public health system also in tatters. Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have been calling since late 2022 for international support to back the fledgling police force, but much of the international community has been jaded by the failure of earlier interventions in Haiti. A breakthrough came in July when Kenya volunteered to lead the force and send 1,000 personnel. A draft resolution seen by AFP calls for the deployment of a ""multinational security support mission"" -- not officially a UN force -- with a ""lead country"" coordinating with the Haitian government. The mission would initially be sent for one year, with a review after nine months. The mission aims to provide ""operational support to the Haitian National Police, including building its capacity through the planning and conduct of joint security support operations"" and will work to ""counter gangs and improve security conditions in Haiti,"" the draft resolution says. The mission will also aim to create conditions to hold elections, which have not taken place in Haiti since 2016. The force will work to ""adopt urgent temporary measures on an exceptional basis"" and, in coordination with Haitian police, will have the authority to make arrests. Haiti has suffered horrific violence, including people being burned alive and rape used as an instrument of terror. Guterres in a recent report said that the situation has only grown worse with the gang members both more numerous and better armed than the police. Nearly 2,800 homicides were recorded in Haiti between October 2022 and June 2023, with 80 minors among the dead, the UN report said. The United States has been advocating a multinational force and recently proposed $100 million in support, but President Joe Biden has made clear he will not put US troops in harm's way. The resolution needs to have the backing of China, which holds veto power on the Security Council. Haiti is one of a dwindling number of nations that recognizes Taiwan, which Beijing claims and has been seeking to isolate on the international stage. China in the run-up to the Security Council meeting has voiced doubts and pointed a finger at the United States, highlighting the role of weapons from Florida in aggravating the violence. Under pressure from China, the latest version of the resolution expands an embargo on light weapons and ammunition. The draft resolution does not specify the size of the mission, although discussions have revolved around a force of about 2,000 personnel. Jamaica, The Bahamas and Antigua and Barbuda have all offered support to the mission. The resolution also calls for the support mission to ""adopt appropriate wastewater management."" A UN peacekeeping force in Haiti that lasted from 2004 to 2017 introduced cholera to the country, setting off an epidemic that killed more than 10,000 people. The experience fueled even greater pessimism in Haiti on interventions and contributed to resistance against another force under the UN flag.",en

Speaking to a packed auditorium in the central African nation's capital Kinshasa, the doctor told reporters he would stand for president in order to save a country riven by insecurity and poor leadership. ""Our country is doing badly,"" said Mukwege, 68. ""We cannot wait to act,"" he added. ""Tomorrow is already too late."" Mukwege was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 alongside Yazidi activist Nadia Murad for efforts to end sexual violence as a weapon of war. The pioneering doctor founded the Panzi hospital and foundation in conflict-torn eastern Democratic Republic of Congo after witnessing the horrific injuries and diseases suffered by rape victims. Dozens of militias have ravaged eastern DRC for years, a legacy of regional wars that flared during the 1990s and 2000s. One such militia, the M23, has captured swathes of territory since launching an offensive in late 2021. Alongside his medical work, Mukwege has earned a reputation as a strident government critic in his native country and built-up a loyal following among the DRC's intellectual class. His announcement of a presidential bid follows months of speculation that he harboured political ambitions. On September 16, Mukwege declared that his supporters had donated the $100,000 deposit needed to launch a run for the presidency in the DRC. ""When the people decides to take power, no system can oppose it,"" he said at the time, without explicitly declaring a bid. Mukwege's speech in Kinshasa on Monday was broadcast live to two halls in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province, where his announcement drew rapturous applause. The city is the home of Mukwege's Panzi hospital, which has specialised in treating survivors of sexual violence since opening in 1999 amid the ravages of the Second Congo War. Although that conflict is over, militia violence continues, and Mukwege recently said the war on women's bodies has continued apace -- and even extended to children. The doctor, during his many lecture tours abroad, has called for an international tribunal to adjudicate crimes in eastern DRC. In the country's election scheduled for December 20, Mukwege will face off against incumbent President Felix Tshisekedi, who came to power after an election in 2018. Other declared opposition candidates include Martin Fayulu, who ran unsuccessfully in 2018, and two ex-prime ministers of Tshisekedi's predecessor Joseph Kabila -- Augustin Matata and Adolphe Muzito. Business magnate Moise Katumbi is also expected to announce a bid. The deadline for candidates to announce their bids is October 8. The presidential election, which is due to be held alongside a parliamentary vote, will be a single-round poll. Barring new political alliances forged ahead of the vote, the political opposition is heading into the presidential election fractured and relatively weak.",en

The company running the Teatre and Fonda Milagros nightclubs had only had a permit to run one of them, the deputy mayor said. It was unclear why the clubs had been able to keep operating since then. At least 13 people died, with people from Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Spain among the dead, reports said. Victims also included family members celebrating a birthday, local media reported. Investigations into the fire are ongoing and officials have not yet identified the cause. Murcia's Deputy Mayor Antonio Navarro told reporters that the city council had ordered the Teatre and Fonda Milagros nightclubs to close in January 2022. The company operating them only had a license to run the Teatre and not the Fonda Milagros, which was created later, he said, according to AFP. He vowed to find out who was responsible for the fire but did not explain how the venues had been able to keep operating since being told to close. Police believe the fire broke out in the Fonda Milagros and then spread to the Teatre and a third nightclub in the building called the Golden. ""The fatalities were all concentrated in a very small area in the Fonda establishment,"" a police spokesman said. A man who gave his name as Jairo said he was the father of one of the victims and said he had not heard from his 28-year-old daughter since receiving a voice note at about 06:00 local time. ""Mum, I love you. We're going to die. I love you mum,"" a young woman's voice could be heard crying on the recording. Murcia Mayor Jose Ballesta has decreed three days of mourning in Murcia.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a second malaria vaccine, a decision that could offer countries a cheaper and a more readily available option than the world’s first shot against the parasitic disease. The R21/Matrix-M, developed by Britain’s Oxford University, can be used to curb the life-threatening disease spread to humans by some mosquitoes, the WHO said on Monday. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN health agency was approving the newmalaria vaccinebased on the advice of two expert groups, recommending its use in children at risk of the disease. “As a malaria researcher, I used to dream of the day we would have a safe and effective vaccine against malaria. Now we have two,” Tedros said. The R21/Matrix-M vaccine is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and has already been approved for use in Burkina Faso, Ghana and Nigeria. The vaccine will be rolled out in those African countries in early 2024 and will be available in mid-2024 in other countries, Tedros said, adding that doses would cost from $2 to $4. “WHO is now reviewing the vaccine for prequalification, which is WHO stamp of approval, and will enable GAVI [a global vaccine alliance] and UNICEF to buy the vaccine from manufacturers,” Tedros said. Oxford University developed the new three-dose vaccine with help from the Serum Institute of India. Research has suggested it is more than 75 percent effective and protection is maintained for at least another year with a booster. Neither of the malaria vaccines available, however, stop transmission, so immunisation campaigns alone won’t be enough to stop epidemics. Efforts to curb the disease are also being complicated by increasing reports of resistance to the main drugs used to treat malaria and the spread of invasive mosquito species.      Tedros said the WHO had also recommended Takeda Pharmaceuticals’ vaccine againstdenguefor children aged six to 16 living in areas where the infection is a significant public health problem. Dengue, common in tropical and subtropical climates, is a viral infection spread from mosquitoes to people. Takeda’s vaccine, called Qdenga, was shown in trials to be effective against all four serotypes of the virus in people who were previously infected with dengue, Hanna Nohynek, chairwoman of the WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, told journalists. She added, however, that there remained uncertainty about its performance against serotypes 3 and 4 in people who have not been infected previously. Nearly 1,000 people have died of dengue this year in anongoing epidemic in Bangladesh, the country’s worst outbreak of the disease. The WHO’s strategic advisory group also recommended a simplified single dose regime for primary immunisation for mostCOVID-19 vaccinesto improve acceptance of the shots at a time when most people have had at least one prior infection               Follow Al Jazeera English:",en

Russia's largest private oil company Lukoil and Gazprom subsidiary Gazpromneft delivered 1 million barrels of Arctic-grade crude to Ghana's oil refinery in Tema, the outlet wrote, citing data from energy analytics firm Kpler. Ship tracking data shows that Russia had sent no crude to the West African country since at least 2018 – until it resumed exports in the spring, with the an initial delivery 600,000 barrels of Siberian Light crude. Ghana is a minor oil-exporting country, sitting alongside sub-Saharan Africa's two major oil suppliers, Nigeria and Angola. Its exports have averaged 140,000 barrels a day over the past six months. But with increased shipments of Russian oil, Ghana may be looking to become a bigger regional supplier, the outlet said. Bloomberg earlier reported that one of the Russian cargos was purchased by Platon Gas Oil Ghana, a plant adjacent to the Tema refinery, built by the Sentuo Group as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. The new plant will be able to process about 40,000 barrels a day during its first phase of operations, increasing to 100,000 barrels once a second construction phase is completed in January 2024, the company said. Western sanctions on oil and petroleum products have prompted Russia, once Europe's biggest supplier, to divert its energy exports, with India and China becoming the top buyers. At the same time, many European consumers have been looking for loopholes allowing indirect purchases of sanctioned oil, using countries that had not joined the ban, as back doors to bypass their own restrictions. Meanwhile, even before the start of oil shipments, Ghana had already emerged as West Africa's top buyer of Russian petroleum products. According to Kpler, the country has purchased 200,000 tons of diesel since March, and also received cargos of naphtha and gasoline in September. Aside from direct oil exports, Russian companies are looking into opportunities for crude extraction in West Africa. Lukoil already owns a 38% stake in the deep-water Tano project in Ghana's offshore zone, where deposits are estimated at 450-550 million barrels, according to Kommersant. The field was initially operated by Norway's Aker (50% share). However, last year the company halted exploration at the deposit over fears of anti-Russia sanctions, and in the spring of 2023 sold its share to the Africa Finance Corp.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo’sDenis Mukwege, a doctor who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on sexual violence in warfare, has said he will seek the presidency. The 68-year-old Mukwege made the announcement before a crowd of supporters in the DRC capital of Kinshasa on Monday, challenging current PresidentFelix Tshisekediin the upcoming December elections. “I agree to be your candidate for president of the republic,” he stated, adding that he would focus on issues such as insecurity and political leadership. Mukwege, a surgical gynaecologist who jointly won the Nobel Prize in 2018 with Yazidi activist Nadia Murad for their efforts tocombat the useof sexual violence as a weapon of war, now hopes to confront problems facing the DRC.      The doctor founded Panzi Hospital in eastern DRC during a period of brutal conflict in 1999, treating hundreds of victims of rape and bearing witness to the injuries and diseases inflicted on them. Today, the Central African nation faces deteriorating security, withnumerous militia groups, including oneknown as M23, fighting for control of territory in the country’s eastern regions. President Tshisekedi has struggled to contain the violence during his first term in office, andhastened the withdrawalof a United Nations peacekeeping force in September amid complaints about its ineffectiveness and lack of popularity. A month earlier, the country’s military came under heavy criticism for usinglethal forceagainst a planned protest against the UN force, in a harsh crackdown that killed 56 people. In apress releaselast month, Mukwege said he was “deeply outraged by the shocking images of the massacre” and called for “far-reaching reform” to professionalise the country’s security services. Debate over issues such as security and economic hardship have become more acute as the country approaches parliamentary and presidential elections, scheduled to take place on December 20. Opposition leader Martin Fayulu, who came in second behind Tshisekedi in the 2018 elections, also announced over the weekend that he will mount a bid for the presidency.

I suddenly felt sick, ripping off the headset but the nausea stayed with me for hours. It was a rookie error. The disconnect between what my eyes saw and my body felt was too much. I've since discovered I can play gentler, less disorientating games, but the nausea still begins to creep in. Sickness in VR affects a lot of people so finding a solution is critical if Mark Zuckerberg's ambition to create a ""metaverse"" that people actually want to spend time in is to be realised. The boss of Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said last year that while motion sickness was still the ""biggest issue"" facing VR but claimed ""it is getting better"". So it that true? Meta is set to launch its latest headset, the Quest 3 and, in the interest of research, I strapped it on and waited to feel sick. Unlike the last version, the Quest 3 has cameras that allow the user to see through the headset to the real world in full colour.  It means games can be played virtually but set in your physical surroundings. Think of a digital character sitting on your coffee table and you've got the idea. This isn't the first ""mixed reality"" headset but it is the first affordable-ish one at $499 (£411). Happily, the nausea remained at bay. I started off with a showcase for the tech called First Encounters.  It began in the room I was standing in. As I shot projectiles, the walls crumbled, revealing a virtual world that I could peer into. Small green furballs began to jump at me.  I could see people in the room as I was playing and see the walls. I could move around in my surroundings confidently.  The same held true as I tried Stranger Things - a mixed reality game version of the hit Netflix series. I didn't feel sick at all. Chris Cox, chief product officer at Meta, said that mixed reality ""changes drastically how comfortable the [VR] experience is"".  His team knows ""context switches"" - from reality to VR - ""can be tough"".  But here's the thing: if the solution to solving VR sickness is to avoid playing full VR is that really a fix? Mr Zuckerberg thinks motion sickness can be reduced with better graphics and less latency (the delay between doing something and seeing it on the headset). He hopes that the better the headsets get, the fewer people will report problems.  But part of feeling ill is based simply on your eyes seeing things that the rest of your body isn't experiencing.  So I had a go at a completely virtual reality boxing game. I pulled the headset over my eyes, and suddenly my surroundings were gone. I played for a few minutes, punching imaginary targets. The graphics felt crisper - light-years ahead of earlier models. But for me, it was still not enough.  I didn't feel sick, but an unwanted dizziness began to creep in, meaning my brain was still telling me that it is not enjoying the experience.  As Mr Zuckerberg acknowledges, people experience motion sickness differently. Some people get sea sickness, and some don't.  Some people play VR for hours on end without a problem. But I can't.  Mixed reality is still very new, with few games. But maybe it is the solution for people like me who like the idea of playing games virtually - but haven't the stomach for it. ",en

As we immerse ourselves in this digital age, we encounter not onlyaugmented realitiesbut also the promise of a future where the boundaries between the virtual and the physical become increasingly fluid. Standing at this transformative juncture, it is both exciting and imperative to explore the vast potential spatial computing holds and understand the profound ramifications it will have on every facet of our daily lives. In the vast technological innovation landscape, few sectors have experienced the stratospheric growth witnessed by the AR/VR B2C segment. The meteoric rise of augmented andvirtual realityapplications is not just a testament to its popularity; it underscores the fundamental shift in how consumers perceive, interact with, and immerse themselves in digital worlds. Statistics paint a vivid picture of this trajectory, spotlighting a leap from a robust $31.12 billion in 2023 to an eye-watering $52.05 billion projection by 2027. This 67% growth over a mere four-year span is not just about numbers. It encapsulates the burgeoning enthusiasm, market demand, and the potential these technologies hold in revolutionizing experiences across sectors—from entertainment and gaming to education and healthcare. Spatial computingpresents a rich tapestry of experiences that blur the boundaries between our physical environment and digital overlays. This spectrum is vast at its core, encapsulating various shades of reality. Starting with our raw, unfiltered surroundings, we have what is simply termed “Reality.” This is the world as we know it, untouched and unaffected by any digital influence. It is the foundation upon which the other layers of spatial computing rest. Next in line is “Augmented Reality” or AR. AR does not replace our world; it enhances it. Imagine walking through a city and seeing historical information pop up as you approach a monument or perhaps visualizing a piece of furniture in your living room before making a purchase. Tools such as Lumus’ Z-Lens or Elbit’s Everysight represent this evolution, enriching our vision by merging AR with everyday needs like prescription eyewear. “Mixed Reality” (MR) takes this a step further. In this realm, the lines between the physical and digital worlds are not just blurred but intertwined. Digital entities are not just passive overlays; they interact and respond to our physical world. Products like Apple Vision Pro exemplify this, allowing users to see digital content that not just overlays but actively blends and interacts with their physical surroundings. The spectrum culminates in “Virtual Reality” (VR). A complete immersion into a digital universe, VR offers escapism at its finest. Every sight, sound, and sometimes even touch is artificially generated. Meta Quest 2 stands as a testament to this immersive experience, plunging users into environments where every element is a construct of digital design. As we continue to traverse this spectrum, it becomes clear that spatial computing is not just about tech or fancy gadgets. It is about reshaping the fabric of our experiences, merging the tangible with the intangible, and crafting a future where our imaginations only limit our realities. The transformative potential of spatial computing stands at the forefront of a new work paradigm. Envision a reality where international boundaries blur, making way for holographic business conferences conducted from the remotest parts of our planet. Or consider the potent efficiency brought by mixed reality, enhancing collaborative design processes and project visualizations. A standout example of this transformative power lies in the production domain: BAE factory workers, empowered by AR, have dramatically reduced their manual building time by an impressive 40%. This is not merely about technological marvels but crafting a workspace without traditional limitations. As spatial computing evolves, the need for physical tools like keyboards or displays diminishes, pointing towards a future that champions adaptability, connectivity, and remote operational freedom. Entertainment, a realm ever-fluid and evolving, finds itself on the cusp of another significant metamorphosis, courtesy of spatial computing. The gaming universe, especially within the burgeoning metaverse, is being reshaped. Titles such asEspire 2and the globally beloved Pokémon GO are not just games but experiences, drawing players into realms of uncharted immersion. However, the revolution is not confined to gaming alone. Fashion and cutting-edge tech are birthing innovations like Marga Weiman’s Hyperfabric Dress. Such integrations signal a future where one’s attire is not just a style statement but an interactive extension of oneself. Complementing these visual revolutions are strides in spatial audio. These are not mere advancements but reinventions, promising listeners and players auditory journeys that are as rich and layered as real-life symphonies. In the realm of learning, spatial computing stands as a game-changer. It offers opportunities for enriched interactive learning, allowing students to virtually visit historical eras or distant landmarks. The very act of notetaking evolves, with students jotting down points in the digital realm and accessing them effortlessly. The healthcare domain witnesses profound transformations with spatial computing. As seen with Augmedics, surgical outcomes improve, which overlays anatomically accurate spinal placements. The ability to monitor and diagnose in real-time, coupled with AR-assisted procedures, heralds a new age of medical precision and patient care. While smartphones have been ubiquitous, their reign may be waning. The global smartphone market dipped by 14% in 2023, while AR glasses witnessed a 45% surge in sales. This shift signals a future where near-to-eye displays become our primary interface. Delving into the realm of AR glasses, the magic lies in the enhanced visuals they provide and the intricate engineering underpinning them. Central to this innovation is Waveguide Technology, a marvel that transforms how we view the digital and the real convergence. The Reflective Waveguide, equipped with its unique embedded facets, paves the way for colors to coexist within the same waveguide, thus granting users an expansive 80-degree field of vision and altering how we perceive augmented overlays. Conversely, the Diffractive Waveguide, in its bid to provide a richer, layered experience, utilizes multiple waveguides. While this adds depth and dimension, it also demands a greater energy output. Powering these intricate waveguides are micro-displays, harnessing innovative OLED and Laser technologies. These not only serve as the engines propelling the visuals but are the alchemists, transforming data into the mesmerizing virtual images that redefine our realities. As we peer into the horizon of what the future holds, the imprint of spatial computing is unmistakable. It is not just about a technological transition; it signifies an evolution in the human experience itself. How we perceive our surroundings, communicate with one another, and engage with digital and physical environments are undergoing profound shifts. Spatial computing opens a gateway to new modalities of interaction, merging our senses with intricate layers of digital augmentation. Gone are the days when technology and reality were siloed entities. In this evolving paradigm, they entwine seamlessly, offering a symphony of experiences previously thought impossible. But as with any technological evolution, spatial computing presents its set of challenges. The ethical implications, potential over-reliance, and security concerns must be addressed with foresight and care. While we marvel at the opportunities it presents, navigating its complexities with discernment is equally crucial. What is clear, however, is that we are on the cusp of a transformative era. As the insights from Lumus elucidate, the wave of spatial computing is not just coming; it is already here. As we step into this brave new world, we must approach it with both excitement and responsibility, ensuring that our foray into augmented realities enriches the human experience, making it more profound, connected, and meaningful.

SAN DIEGO — Col. Thomas Bedell had been commanding Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar in San Diego for just one day, in July 2021, when he got a message from the base energy management director. The city power system was straining under a heatwave, and it was time to start up the microgrid. ""So I said, yes! Start up the microgrid! And then I texted, what is the microgrid?"" Bedell recalled with a laugh. It fell to Mick Wasco, who has been energy management director at Miramar since 2010, to explain to Bedell that Miramar was set up to run the base without using power from the city of San Diego in the case of a local or national power grid failure. ""By 2012, we started producing landfill gas electricity specifically for MCS Miramar,"" Wasco said, ""Keep in mind, this is the size of a small city.""

Using energy sources including solar and methane gas from the rotting garbage in a massive San Diego city landfill located inside the base, Miramar can go 21 days in a self-contained state that's called ""island mode."" Or as Col. Bedell says, aircraft carrier mode. ""I half-jokingly refer to Miramar as the USS Miramar. If you think about the installation as an aircraft carrier, suddenly the need to have redundant power to have energy-resilience, water, food-resilience makes complete sense,"" he said.

Bedell, the commanding officer of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, poses for a photo at the station's Energy and Water Operations Center on MCAS Miramar. It makes enough sense that it's official Department of Defensepolicy: The Pentagon's stated goal is that all bases be ""power resilient."" The best path to resilience in case of a disaster is often a local renewable source, and that pairs well with another Pentagon goal — for bases to becarbon neutral by 2050. That will keep key defense capabilities intact in the case of an attack on the U.S. power grid, or more likely an extreme weather event, as climate change worsens droughts, heatwaves, wildfires and storms.

Right: Diesel engine in the engine room at MCAS Miramar.Alan Nakkash for NPRhide caption Hurricane Michaeldevastated Tyndall Air Force Basein Florida in 2018. The rebuild is incorporating a microgrid built for the base by the local utility. ""Florida Power & Light provides us the ability to 'island' that critical headquarters building and its functions from the rest of the installation, should there be a power loss,"" says Mike Dwyer, deputy chief of the Air Force Natural Disaster Recovery Division. Getting industry partners involved made funding and building the microgrid faster than the Pentagon's normally glacial procurement process. In the next big storm, Dwyer said, the base will be able to keep up critical defense operations. ""It's designed to operate the first Air Force or Air Force's North Headquarters building completely independently for up to four and a half hours,"" he said. Dwyer said Tyndall is still at least 3 to 5 years away from having a grid that could run the whole base. A Pentagon spokesperson said 90% of key bases worldwide have at least a plan on becoming energy independent, and the Defense Department currently gets 15.9% of its energy from renewable sources, and expects to be at 25% renewable by 2025.

The DoD is among the world'slargest emitters of carbon dioxide,so it's exciting to see them take an interest in renewables, said Lisa Cohn with the site Microgrid Knowledge. ""The military's interest in microgrids is really, really important — because the military does tend to deploy new technologies before anyone else,"" she said. The progress is mostly driven by the fact that it makes tactical sense. It can save soldiers' lives at war. Producing energy on base means trucks don't have to haul in fuelfor generators to power bases in war zones, a vulnerability that proved deadly in Afghanistan and Iraq. Brandon Newell was a Marine artilleryman in 2003. He remembers rushing north from Kuwait into Iraq, only to run out of fuel. ""It was about speed and agility and moving fast to attack Baghdad. We outran our logistics and it was ... a pause for four days sitting on side of the road so that our logistics could catch up,"" he said. That experience marked him. Newell firstspoke to NPR in 2011at a remote combat outpost in Helmand, Afghanistan where he was setting up small-scale renewable power for the Marine Corps. Detail of diesel engine at MCAS Miramar.Alan Nakkash for NPRhide caption Newell says the troops don't really care if it's a carbon-neutral solution — as long as it helps them fight and survive. In Afghanistan, resupply convoys hit by roadside bombs were making up a huge share ofU.S. military casualties. ""We have these distributed forces that are constantly requiring bullets, band aids, food and fuel,"" he said, ""These huge convoys make you even more of a target."" Newell retired as colonel, and started a company promoting the mobile combat energy solutions he says will be even more important in the next war. He spent his last years in the Marine Corps helping stand-up the microgrid at Miramar Air Base. Miramar is also demonstrating how microgrids in the military can make the civilian power-grid more resilient. It can provide a working headquarters during storms or heatwaves for the state or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), according to Col. Bedell. Exterior of MCAS Miramar microgrid rooms in San Diego, California.Alan Nakkash for NPRhide caption Exterior of MCAS Miramar microgrid rooms in San Diego, California. ""Our ability to be able to continue to operate and provide that base from which we could help the local community or the state is really important,"" he said. It makes sense for every state to have disaster-resilient grids on military bases, he said, and Miramar has already helped out. During a heatwave in 2022, the state energy grid was under theheaviest load in California's history. This time, Bedell got a surprise text from San Diego Gas & Electric asking if Miramar could go off city power to reduce the load and avoid outages. ""At the request of SDG&E, we turned on the micro grid to support our own utility requirements during peak hours for 10 days in a row. And that that prevented about 3,000 homes from having to go into potential blackout,"" said Bedell. The Navy even ""unplugged"" its docked ships from the city's power grid to help. While the military tends to focus on the use of microgrids against tactical threats, Bedell says climate change itself is also one of those threats. ""We need to be part of this solution. And if we are negatively impacting the climate change that is causing societal disruption, that's not working ourselves out of a job. That's creating the problem that we're wanting to solve,"" he said. Loading...",en

background paragraph 6) MAPUTO/LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Mozambique will turn
its attention to pursuing compensation from shipbuilder
Privinvest in London, officials said on Monday, after the
republic struck an 11th-hour settlement with Credit Suisse over
the $1.5 billion-plus ""tuna bond"" scandal. Mozambique Finance Minister Max Tonela confirmed at a Maputo
news conference that Sunday's deal with Credit Suisse's parent
UBS and some creditors only covered a 2013 loan to
Proindicus, a state Mozambican company, and was ""mutually
advantageous"". ""This agreement opens the door to the possibility of
restoring the confidence of international investors in
Mozambique,"" Tonela said. The tuna bond case dates back to deals between
state-owned Mozambican companies and shipbuilder Privinvest -
funded in part by loans and bonds from Credit Suisse and backed
by undisclosed Mozambican government guarantees in 2013 and 2014
- ostensibly to develop the fishing industry and for maritime
security. But hundreds of millions of dollars went missing and, when
the government debt came to light in 2016, donors such as the
International Monetary Fund temporarily halted support,
triggering a currency collapse, defaults and financial turmoil. Mozambique has said it was the victim of a conspiracy and
that Privinvest paid bribes to corrupt Mozambican officials and
Credit Suisse bankers, exposing the nation to a potential
liability of at least $2 billion. Tonela and Deputy Attorney General Angelo Matusse
declined to say how much compensation Mozambique is now pursuing
from French shipping mogul Iskandar Safa and his
Emirati-Lebanese shipbuilder. Safa and Privinvest - which has said it delivered on its
contractual obligations and any payments made were investments,
consultancy payments, legitimate remuneration or political
campaign contributions - have denied any wrongdoing. Sunday's settlement, struck one day before a blockbuster
London trial was due to begin, prompted scores of lawyers
representing Mozambique, Credit Suisse, Privinvest, three former
Credit Suisse bankers, creditors and others, to gather in the
High Court to establish how the trial should now proceed. Judge Robin Knowles said there was an imperatives to
ensure the three-month trial of a ""complicated and interwoven
multi-party case"" was fair to all parties and postponed the
opening of the trial to at least Oct. 16. Duncan Matthews, for Privinvest, told the court that the
settlement had created a ""significant shift"" in burden to his
clients and that they should have time to work out which claims
and cross claims remained on the table. He also noted that it was ""not quite clear"" whether
Mozambique's claims against three former Credit Suisse bankers
had also been settled or put on hold. The deal includes ""the extinguishment of the total amount of
debt that Credit Suisse claimed from Mozambique"", read a
statement posted after the press conference on the Facebook page
of Mozambique's Attorney General. Under the deal, UBS will forgive part of a loan that Credit
Suisse made to Mozambique in 2013, representing less than $100
million, said one source familiar with the situation, who
declined to be named because the terms are not public. Mozambique is paying 3.5 million pounds ($4.26 million) per
month to its London legal team. Legal fees have swollen to $80
million since 2019, Matusse said.

The Republican-led 45-day stopgap spending bill, which dropped support for Ukraine, won enough support from House Democrats tooverwhelmingly passwith 315 votes. Sadly, some congressional leaders have been emboldened to walk away from Ukraine givensome surveys claiming 55% of voters do not believe Congress should authorize additional fundingto support Ukraine—a reversal from 62% in favor this time last year. Though both parties deserve credit for preventing a government shutdown, the reneging of support for Ukraine will have disastrous ripple effects and plays directly into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s only winning hand—propaganda and attrition—to weaken allied support. Here are the facts that voters ought to understand about American support for Ukraine. First, Ukraine is not the financial sinkhole anti-Ukraine extremists would like to portray, and U.S. support for Ukraine is far cheaper than it seems. For all its mistaken use as a political hot potato in budget talks, the$43 billion on U.S. military aid to Ukrainesince Russia invaded amounts to about 5% of the U.S. defense budget and lessthan 1% of total government spending. This is not an insignificant sum but, to put things in perspective, it’s equivalent to the amount the U.S. is spending on such mundane items such assoftware for government agencies; COVIDrental relief, andhighway safety programs. The weapons the U.S. is sending, like the186 Bradley tanksso prized by Ukraine, from our stockpiles are likewise not breaking the bank. Unlike other foreign adventures, the U.S. is not shouldering the load alone as European countries have contributed anequivalent amountinmilitary aid themselvesandtwice as much in humanitarian support. Some European countries such as Estonia are settingaside half their defense budgetfor Ukraine’s defense, an order of magnitude higher than U.S. support. And most importantly, the U.S. has sent no American troops to Ukraine and zero American lives have been lost with the Ukrainians doing all the fighting. Europe stands mostly united with the U.S. in support for Ukraine. Poland and Lithuania were the first to sever all Russian gas purchases and Germany’s new LNG terminals made it possible for the entire EU to follow, a huge flip from the Nordstream I and II promise.  Furthermore, the mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski told me in his office last month that fully 20% of Poland’s population are warmly welcomed, productively employed Ukrainian refugees. It takes little for Poles across sectors and parties to recall their history with Russia from the 1930s mass slaughter of tens of thousands inthe Katyn Forestwhen they though Russia was their ally to Lech Walesa’s overthrow of Russian domination 50 years later. With upcoming acrimonious elections in Poland elevated partisan tensions, leaders of both parties tell me that their animosity towards Putin and Russia transcends any political divides. For our miniscule financial investment, the U.S. is reaping massive returns. Ukraine has already destroyed50% of Russia’s military mightby some measures, forcing Putin to spend well over$150 billionon the country’s military replenishment. Ukraine’s counteroffensive may not be going as fast as some would have liked, but it is makingprogress. Economically, sanctions combined with the exodus ofover 1,000 private sector companieshavechoked Russia’s economy, withsome sectors down from 60 to 90%. Combined with escalating war costs, Putin is being forced tocannibalize the productive economyto replenish his coffers, basically tossing the living room furniture into the fireplace in desperation. On the other hand, Ukraine is bustling with energy and enthusiasm. Having justreturned from a visitto Kyiv, Iwitnessed first-hand howUkrainians from combat veterans to young professionals to baristas in the café areeager to contributeto the reconstruction of a new, modernized, Westernized Ukraine. Appeasement is not a serious choice; if the U.S. chooses not to fund military assistance to Ukraine as Republicans like Matt Gaetz and Rand Paul would have it, or if the U.S. forces Ukraine to surrender its lands as even New York Times columnistThomas Friedman has proposed, we are surely staring at even higher costs moving forward. Putin’s expansionist agenda does not stop at Ukraine, and next up will be Poland, Moldova, Finland, Sweden, and others. He has already signaled as much—in a July 2021 essay, “On the Historical Unity of Russia and Ukraine,” Putin not only foreshadowed his intention to invade Ukraine but made sweeping claims to the historical unity of Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Georgia, and Kazkakhstan as extensions ofRusskiy Mir, or the “Russian world.” And even more importantly, if the U.S. abandons Ukraine, China may be emboldened to seize Taiwan. The consequences of that would stretch far beyond the Asia-Pacific region—the self-ruling island controlsabout 70% of the global semiconductorsupply, which is critical to everything from the smartphones in our pockets to the military hardware the U.S. military depends on. Anyone who still advocates for appeasement in the face of a dictator who has already invaded three countries—Georgia in 2008, the Syrian intervention in 2013, and Ukraine in 2014 and again in 2022—is dangerously misreading the threat that the Russian leader poses to the world. This is missing the lessons of World War II on the 85thanniversary of Neville Chamberlain’s ill-fated concession to Hitler in the Munich Agreement where parallel land of seized German speaking Czechoslovakia we surrendered to Germany in an effort at making peace. The simpler choice is to spend less than 1% of the government budget to support Ukraine’s defense today, or to spend much more in the future amid empowered foreign adversaries, potential NATO activation, and even U.S. boots on the ground. Putin is reeling, and the only arrow left in his quiver is to use propaganda and attrition to wear down allied support. While keeping the government running is worthy of celebration, dropping Ukraine was hardly necessary to avoid a government shutdown. After all, just two days ago, the House voted overwhelmingly to support assistance to Ukraine, including over 100 Republicans. Now it will take a separate legislative act to pass funding for Ukraine; Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell may have to channel the heroic role of former GOP Senator Arthur Vandenberg, a former isolationist, who helped fortify wavering GOP support for the Marshall Plan among his colleagues after World War II. But even if Ukraine funding eventually passes, thanks to today’s mistakes, Putin will be freshly empowered, thinking that U.S. support for Ukraine is weakening, and we will be paying even higher costs for a long time to come.",en

New MOFs designed and made in this way range from narrow-windowed materials with gas separation potential to larger-windowed structures with potential medical applications due to their excellent oxygen-adsorption capacity.""One of the most challenging goals in new structure design is the precise control of structure formation,"" says Aleksandr Sapianik, a postdoc in the group of Mohamed Eddaoudi, who led the research. For reticular chemistry—the assembly of molecular building blocks into porous crystalline materials such as MOFs—the centering formwork concept might offer thatprecise control, the team realized.The starting point of the research was a zeolite-like MOF (ZMOF), which usually features pentagonal windows framed by building blocks called supertetrahedra (ST). ""Our goal was to control ST arrangement to change from this well-known topology to one not reported before with these building blocks,"" Sapianik says.The team developed centering structure-directing agents (cSDA) to control ST alignment and form ZMOF windows of new shapes and sizes. One set of cSDAs, designed to tighten the angle between adjoining ST units, created small windows. Another set, designed to expand the angle between ST units, gave larger windows.""MOF pore size and volume are important parameters that affect their application,"" says Marina Barsukova, a postdoc in Eddaoudi's team. One large-windowed ZMOF the team designed, Fe-sod-ZMOF-320, showed the highest oxygen adsorption capacity of any MOF known.""This property is important in the medical and aerospace industries, where the high capacity would increase oxygen storage in a cylinder, or enable smaller cylinders for easier transport,"" Barsukova says. The same ZMOFs also performed well for storage of methane and hydrogen, which are potential fuels. Other ZMOFs in the family with narrow windows showed potential for gas separation of molecular mixtures.The cSDA concept offers multiple benefits enhancing MOF performance, says Vincent Guillerm, a research scientist in Eddaoudi's group. ""The cSDA partitions big windows into smaller ones, which our preliminary results suggest will be useful for chemical separations,"" he says. ""It also offers additional internal pore surface, which can help to improve gas storage, and reinforces the MOF framework, which should improve the material's stability,"" he adds.""The centering approach we have developed is another powerful strategy in the repertoire of reticular chemistry, offering great potential for made-to-order MOFs for applications in energy security and environmental sustainability,"" Eddaoudi says.The research appears inNature Synthesis.",en

New research from the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business sheds light on the intriguing ways that people do so.Inthe paper""Do Companies Think and Feel? Mind Perception of Organizations,"" published August 16 inCognitive Science, Simone Tang, assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Peter and Stephanie Nolan School of Hotel Administration, and her co-author explore how people attribute human qualities to organizations by attributing ""minds"" to organizations—and how that may influence their opinions after organizational wrongdoing.Four distinct studies by Tang and co-author Kurt Gray, professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, reveal new paths to comprehend how people understand these abstract entities. The research delves into a debate inorganizational psychology: Can humanizing an organization lead people to see it more positively? Tang's insight is that organizational humanization involves people attributing a mind to the organization. Having a full mind like a human being—capable of experiencing emotions and feelings—is key to positive evaluations, including an organization receiving forgiveness after wrongdoing.Tang found that one way to construct a mind was to frame the building blocks of an organization—its members and goals—as being emotionally driven or not.""We provided descriptions of companies that would make people feel like the organization's members and goals were focused on creating and influencing emotional experiences or not. For example, [in one study] a Dollar Store was described as composed of employees who are prone to express their emotions, with the goal of making customers feel cared for, and in another study, the Dollar Store was composed of employees who are strategic, with the goal of accomplishing tasks for customers efficiently. The former description made people feel like the organization had amindmore similar to a human being than the latter,"" Tang said.When organizations commit wrongdoing, those perceived to possess minds similar to human beings are seen as more sincere in their apologies. Forgiveness also flows more readily. Evennegative emotions, such as anger, can shape the perception of an organization as being more similar to a person.""Our research reveals how people understand the minds of organizations, challenging traditional ideas that organizations are merely inanimate objects,"" Gray said.The research suggests that companies may benefit from developing a reputation of caring about the emotional experiences of customers in addition to the success of their business model. However, there is a fine balance. Tang and Gray also found potential downsides to organizations having experience and expressing emotion in that they can be seen as somewhat less effective at being profitable and successful.""Overall, the insight that we can induce people to perceive minds in organizations, especially experiential minds, has important implications for how we respond to organizationalwrongdoingand their attempts at atonement,"" Tang said.",en

The decision on the future of the building in Braunau am Inn, a town on Austria's border with Germany, was made in late 2019. Plans call for a police station, the district police headquarters and a security academy branch where police officers will get human rights training. On Monday, workers put up fencing and started taking measurements for the construction work.The police are expected to occupy the premises in early 2026. A years-long back-and-forth over the ownership of the house preceded the overhaul project. The question was resolved in 2017 when Austria’s highest court ruled that the government was within its rights to expropriate the building after its owner refused to sell it. A suggestion it might be demolished was dropped. The building had been rented by Austria’s Interior Ministry since 1972 to prevent its misuse, and was sublet to various charitable organizations. It stood empty after a care centre for adults with disabilities moved out in 2011. A memorial stone with the inscription “for freedom, democracy and liberty. Never again fascism. Millions of dead remind us” is to remain in place outside the house. The Austrian government argues that having the police, as the guardians of civil liberties, move in is the best use for the building. But there has been criticism of the plan. Historian Florian Kotanko complained that “there is a total lack of historical contextualization.” He argued that the Interior Ministry's intention of removing the building's “recognition factor” by remodelling it ""is impossible to accomplish.” “Demystification should be a key part,” he added, arguing in favour of a suggestion that an exhibition on people who saved Jews under Nazi rule should be shown in the building.",en

This research was conducted while Galewsky was on sabbatical in France at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD) in Paris.The idea that thunderstorms can aggregate has been known for decades, but the impacts onwater vaporand the use of stable isotopes in water vapor to track these processes are quite new. There is evidence that the clumping of clouds has a surprisingly large impact on climate.In this research, the team of international scientists used remote sensing data to investigate how the organization of clouds affects the chemistry of water vapor in the atmosphere. These clouds can range from individual cells to larger systems like tropical cyclones. The study focused on the global tropics from 2015 to 2020.One of the key discoveries of the research was that cloud organization impacts the distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere. They found that when clouds are not organized (unaggregated), the atmosphere tends to have more moisture but that the water vapor is relatively depleted in deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. This suggests that evaporation from rain contributes to this pattern.""Water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas, actually the most importantgreenhouse gas, and the stable isotopes in water vapor help us to track the processes that govern the distribution of water vapor. What we found was that in regions where thunderstorms are not organized, meaning that the clouds are isolated and look sort of like popcorn, the atmosphere tends to be quite moist,"" said Galewsky.In cases of organized (aggregated) convection, there is less moisture in the atmosphere, but the water vapor is more enriched in deuterium. This implies more transport of water vapor from near the Earth's surface into the upper parts of the atmosphere.""When the clouds are very tightly bundled together, the atmosphere tends to be a lot drier and the water vapor is more is more isotopically enriched, meaning that there's water vapor coming from the boundary layer, the lowest parts of the atmosphere, into the middle atmosphere,"" Galewsky explained.Lastly, they discovered that when convective clouds are moderately organized (intermediate aggregation), there is no significant variation in water vapor isotopic composition.""It gives insight into how this clumping of storms affects the current climate through radiative processes linked to variations in humidity. It also potentially helps us to better understand past climates because the isotopes in water vapor are often recorded in things like cave formations or ice cores,"" Galewsky said.The findings may help in the interpretation of paleoclimate records because past changes in convective cloud organization could lead to isotopic signals that have not been recognized in past research. This is vital for understanding ancient climate variations.""What we found is that the way these clouds are organized can have a big impact on water vapor in the atmosphere. And that is important because it can influence how the earth is able to cool itself off, which has obvious implications forclimate change,"" said Galewsky.This research helps bridge the gap betweentheoretical modelsand real-world observations, allowing the researchers to better understand the complex interactions within the atmosphere. ""People who've been studying convective aggregation have been calling for isotope studies for a long time, and we were the first group to actually be able to pull it off,"" said Galewsky. This will help provide better observational constraints for climate models. The results of this research can help provide new ways for climate modelers to test that their models are working correctly.""Theatmosphereis currently warming, and the evidence is overwhelming that that's due to the burning of fossil fuels. And while the basic physics of climate change is very well understood and has been well understood for more than a century at this point, there are a lot of details that we still don't understand well; in particular, probably the biggest uncertainty in our projection of future climate has to do with clouds and how they affect climate,"" explained Galewsky,""This is a new way of trying to get at this most important uncertainty in climate projections for the future and for New Mexico. This research will help to better constrain those future studies.""",en

<li>Ukraine has battered Russia's Black Sea Fleet with cruise missile strikes and sea drone attac… [+4620 chars]",Ukraine,"Russia is highly likely relying on a decades-old amphibious plane to seek out a dangerous Ukrainian threat to its Black Sea Fleet, according to Western intelligence. Kyiv doesn't have a proper navy, but over the past two months it hasramped up its assaultson the Black Sea Fleet and other high-value targets around the occupied Crimean peninsula as part of its ongoing counteroffensive. This includes cruise missile strikes on a key shipyard and the fleet's headquarters and attacks with uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) — orsea drones— on Russian ships. Sea drones, which are inexpensive and can be packed with explosives, have become a headache for Russia, which can't figure out how toconsistently stopthe systems. Experts say the sea drones give Ukraine an""asymmetric advantage,""prompting leadership in Kyiv toprioritize developingwhat it hails is ""the formation of the world's first naval fleet of drones."" In early August, Ukraine employed sea drones in two major attacks: the first damaged the landing shipOlenegorsky Gornyakat the Russian port of Novorossiysk, and the other""disabled""the Russian merchant tanker Sig near the Kerch Strait. In September, Ukraineclaimedits dronesscored hitson Russian patrol ships and other vessels. Russia's defense ministry challenged these claims, saying its forces foiled these attacks, but the problem still has Moscow searching for solutions, according to Britain's defense ministry. ""In recent weeks, the Naval Aviation component of Russia's Black Sea Fleet has assumed a particularly important role in the Fleet's operations as it struggles to deal with concurrent threats on the southern flank of the Ukraine war,"" Britain's defense ministry wrote in a Mondayintelligence update. ""Naval Aviation is emphasising maritime air patrol operations, highly likely with a primary mission of the early identification of uncrewed surface vessels,"" Britain's defense ministry said. ""A key Russian asset in these operations is the Be-12 MAIL amphibious aircraft, designed in the 1950s, flying out of bases in occupied Crimea."" TheBeriev Be-12is a Soviet-era turboprop aircraft that was designed in the 1950s and first flown in 1960. Capable of flying from both land bases and water, the Be-12 was made to conduct short-range anti-submarine and maritime patrol duties — thanks to a radar, a magnetic anomaly detector, and sonobuoys — and can be armed with torpedoes and mines. Typically flying with a crew of four — two pilots, a navigator, and a radio and sensor operator —the Be-12can reach speeds of nearly 330 mph and fly at a maximum altitude of around 10,000 ft. Because the aircraft is so old, Russia hasstarted replacing itwith the jet-powered Be-200ES. Russia has long kept operational Be-12s at Kacha Air Base in Crimea, where the planes were spottedpatrollinglast year. It remains to be seen if the Be-12 makes a difference in curbing the threat of Ukraine's sea drones. In addition to increasing maritime air patrol operations, Russia has also been conducting maritime strike operations with its combat jets, according to Britain's defense ministry, which noted alikely relocationof Black Sea Fleet activity from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk, a process that was already underway to a certain extent following a sea drone attack last fall. ""With more Fleet activities likely relocating to Novorossiysk in the face of threats to Sevastopol, Russia is attempting to use naval air power to project force over the north-western Black Sea,"" Britain's defense ministry said on Monday. Sevastopol, which is located on the southwestern edge of Crimea and is the home of the Black Sea Fleet, fell victim to two major cruise missile strikes last month, with one targeting akey shipyardand the other hitting thefleet's headquarters. Collectively, these attacks damaged several vessels, and killed and injured scores of Russian personnel. Novorossiysk, on the other hand, is a port located across the Black Sea on Russia's internationally recognized territory, although Ukraine has demonstrated that it can still reach Novorossiysk with its sea drones and inflict damage there.",en

But a new study from SMU fire scientist Christopher Roos published in the journalNature Ecology & Evolutionshows that climate is an undervalued part of the equation.Roos, SMU environmental archaeologist and professor of anthropology, traveled with his team to the Sigatoka River valley in southwestern Fiji in 2013, where they collected charcoal and stable carbon isotopes from deep soil cores to understand historic patterns of fire activity in the area. Different plants have distinct carbon isotopic signatures, which can provide information about past plant communities.The team found fires and fire-createdgrassy areasthat predatehuman settlementby millennia and actively corresponded to droughts likely driven by a regularly occurring weather pattern known as El Niño. El Niño events can alter precipitation patterns worldwide, makingenvironmental conditionsmore favorable for wildfires. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued an El Niño advisory in June, announcing the latest arrival of theclimateevent that continues to influence weather worldwide.Lighting strikes also act as a natural cause of wildfires, igniting plant material that acts as fuel.The impact of human settlement, farming activity (particularly the clearing and burning of land) and resulting deforestation of remote Pacific islands is well established in the scientific record, and research from the Roos team only confirms what Roos calls ""a modern environmental parable."" But the impact of climate must be considered, too, the study finds.""It struck me that these fires are not exclusively human-driven, because when I looked at earlier pre-human spikes in fire activity, those lined up with El Niños,"" said Roos. ""The combination of climate andhuman activitydrives island deforestation and increases wildfire activity. It may be that human activity is making the landscape more sensitive to those climate variations. But, it could also be that the climate is making the landscape more sensitive to human activity.""In the past, Roos said, research often focused more on human activity harming Pacific Islands' land without considering climate's role in the damage. He believes an approach that considers both causes is necessary, especially with catastrophic wildfire events occurring more regularly.Roos also points out that the Pacific Islands are natural laboratories to study the grass-fire cycle, which is prevalent in areas where wildfire is occurring with the spread of invasive grasses. Traditional farmers have practiced successful techniques for clearing and burning land for centuries, and past lessons could offer ways to prepare and cope with future wildfire events. Roos stresses that we must adapt to the new environment climate and humans have created.""Droughts triggered by El Niño events appear to have played a role in intensifying the grass-fire cycle and contributing to deforestation in the past,"" he said. ""And looking forward, climate models indicate that the Pacific Islands could experience conditions similar to El Niño events more frequently due to ongoing climate change. We need to reflect on what we're doing and whether or not those actions make places more or less vulnerable to futurewildfireevents.""",en

RSF fighters on dozens of armed vehicles attacked the town of Wad Ashana, on the border between North Kordofan and White Nile states, on Saturday, according to residents. ""My neighbour and my cousin were both killed in the crossfire. It was hours of terror,"" Al-Tayeb Abdelbaqi told AFP from El Odaydab, a town 10 kilometres (six miles) away to which he could eventually flee, sheltering with a relative along with three other families. Though there have been no credible tolls from the fighting in Wad Ashana, Abdelbaqi said ""there are still bodies lying on the side of the road, and we don't know who they are,"" pleading for ""health organisations to take care of them."" The same sight has been reported in other parts of the country, with volunteers routinely forced to dig mass graves and warning that the real death toll is far higher than figures suggest. By early September, the war between Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, which began on April 15, had killed nearly 7,500 people, according to a conservative estimate from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) project. The worst of the violence has been concentrated in Khartoum and the western region of Darfur, but North Kordofan -- a crossroads between the capital and Darfur -- has also seen fighting. Battles have displaced almost 4.3 million people within Sudan, in addition to around 1.2 million more who have fled across borders. Dozens of families like Abdelbaqi's, who fled to save their lives but left everything behind, were holed up in schools in the area. ""We left with only the clothes on our backs,"" said another resident, Ahmed, who used to own a store in Wad Ashana and asked to only be identified by his first name for fear of retaliation. He said the local market ""had been completely looted."" The same allegation has followed RSF attacks across Sudan since the war began. Footage posted to social media on Sunday by the RSF claimed to show fighters ""taking over the Wad Ashana garrison in North Kordofan and advancing towards Kosti,"" the last major town on the road to South Sudan. UN data shows the neighbouring country has received more than 270,000 refugees since the war began. The Sudanese Armed Forces have not yet issued any comment on the situation in the Wad Ashana region. According to Abdelbaqi, the area had been spared the fighting, until last week, when ""an army force set up camp west of town"". Three days later, ""the RSF attacked the city, completely overtaking it and pushing the army"" 35 kilometres east, he said. Already one of the world's poorest countries, the war has brought a humanitarian catastrophe to Sudan, where millions are on the brink of famine and diseases are spreading, according to the United Nations.",en

It’s expected that the volunteers will have the opportunity to interact with foreign guests in over 50 languages, including 26 Eastern languages. “MGIMO has unique expertise both in the linguistic training of international affairs specialists and in the implementation of youth policy and the training of volunteers,”the director of the MGIMO Volunteer Movement Support Center, Stanislav Surovtsev, said. “The combination of these factors, together with the vast experience of the MGIMO Volunteer Movement Support Center, allows our volunteers to take part in organizing major international events, showing high professionalism when accompanying foreign delegations, protocol support, linguistic services, etc.,”he added. Last month, organizers of the World Youth Festival announced that some 38 national preparatory committees had already begun their work, ahead of the event. The landmark festival, which is set to be held in March next year in Sochi, aims to bring together over 20,000 young leaders from all over the globe, representing more than 30 countries of the Asia-Pacific region, and promote cultural and business ties between young people from different parts of the world. The so-called National Preparatory Committees – which will be tasked with selecting foreign participants, forming delegations, and popularizing the festival – have already begun working in Argentina, Bangladesh, Guatemala, Honduras, Georgia, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Spain, Malaysia, the US, Panama, and Ecuador. Additionally, representatives from Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Canada, China, Thailand, Japan, and other countries have also expressed a desire to take part in the event.",en

Google will award this new label, reminiscent of Intel’s Evo program for Windows PCs, to Chromebooks that meet specific quality benchmarks. The certification lets even those unfamiliar with technical specifications trust products bearing the “Chromebook Plus” label. To be stamped with the Chromebook Plus seal, devices must meet stringent criteria: While many might expect battery life to be a focal point, Google has sidestepped this by emphasizing that all Chromebooks, Plus-certified or not, should adhere to a 10-hour battery life based on their rigorous internal tests. Devices with the Chromebook Plus certification will not only meet hardware benchmarks but will also have exclusive AI-driven features. These include a magic eraser in Google Photos and advanced video conferencing. Users also get AI-curated wallpapers and a writing assistant. They’ll receive a three-month subscription to Photoshop on the Web and GeForce Now’s priority tier. Tech giants Lenovo,HP, and Acer are among the first to adopt this certification. Starting Oct. 8, 2023, new Chromebook Plus laptops will be available for order from major U.S. retailers such as Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, and Target. For those in Canada and Europe, availability begins on Oct. 9.",en

<ul><li>The Educ… [+3568 chars]",Education,"President Joe Biden's Education Department is moving forward withits broad student-debt cancellation plan— and it signaled the categories of borrowers it's keeping an eye on as it crafts the new relief. Last week, the Education Departmentreleased new details on the process to cancel student debtusing the Higher Education Act of 1965. Unlike Biden's first plan to cancel student debt that the Supreme Courtstruck down at the end of June, the Higher Education Act requires the administration undergo negotiated rulemaking — a lengthy process that includes multiple negotiation sessions and periods of public comment. The latest update from the department was the announcement of negotiators who had been selected to participate in the session, along with a paper outlining what the sessions will look like, the first of which will be on October 10 and 11. Thepaperincluded a five distinct categories of borrowers the department is looking to discuss with the negotiation committee: Borrowers whose balances have grown due to unpaid interest, leaving them with larger balances than their original principal Borrowers who are eligible for relief under programs like income-driven repayment but did not apply for those programs Borrowers who attended schools that left them with too much debt compared to post-graduation earnings Borrowers who entered repayment before new benefits became available Borrowers experiencing financial hardship ""in ways that the current student loan system does not adequately address"" These are the first details the department has released so far, and the discussions could be further tailored or changed as the negotiations continue. However, it indicates how Biden is thinking about his new plan for relief by targeting borrowers who have struggled with repayment to no fault of their own. Additionally,there is no guarantee borrowers who qualified for Biden's first debt relief plan will qualify this time around. The first plan was debt cancellation of up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients making under $125,000 a year, and up to $10,000 for other federal borrowers under the same income cap. The amounts of relief, along with whether there will be an income cap, for the new plan are unclear at this point. The progress toward new debt relief comes asmillions of federal borrowers are entering repayment after an over three-year pause. On Sunday, pandemic relief for borrowers officially ended — it marked the first day bills could start becoming due. While Biden announceda series of measures to ease the transition, like a 12-month ""on-ramp"" period during which missed payments would not be reported to credit agencies, borrowers are still struggling to foot the extra monthly expense. Even so, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez previously told borrowersnot to give up hope on broad relief just yet. ""There is absolutely still a chance of cancellation,"" shesaidlast month. ""When the Supreme Court struck it down, they said that the administration couldn't use a specific avenue, namely the HEROES Act, but there are alternative avenues that we have pursued. They are going to be laying out that program over the course of the next year.""",en

Borrell and EU foreign ministers have gathered in Kyiv in a display of support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion. Here's a look ahead and a roundup of key developments from the past week. Ukraine's government is reacting cautiously, so far, to aU.S. stopgap spendingmeasure that leaves out further aid for Ukraine. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kulebasaid MondayKyiv is in contact with U.S. Democrats and Republicans in Congress and is confident funding will continue. President Biden is pressing Republicans to back new Ukraine aid legislation separate from the spending stopgap. In a show of support to Ukraine, European Union foreign ministers met for a rare gathering in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Poland's Warsaw Security Forum ison Tuesday and Wednesday. Evan Gershkovich appeared in publicat a Moscow court last Tuesday. The AmericanWall Street Journalreporter has beendetained in Russia for six months. The courtrejected his appealagainst a decision to extend his pretrial detention. Ukraine claimed to havekilled a commanderof the Russian navy's Black Sea Fleet, but the Kremlin and affiliated news outlets laterreleased footageof Adm. Viktor Sokolov saying he is still alive. NATO's secretary-general made an unannounced visit to Kyivlast Thursday, saying Ukraine has been ""gradually gaining ground"" in its counteroffensive against Russian forces and calling on alliance members to supply more air defense systems. That followed avisit Wednesdayby the British defense secretary, who expressed the United Kingdom's commitment to continue its military support. Canada's Parliament caused an uproar for honoring a Ukrainian Nazi veteranfrom World War II, after an address there by visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ninety-eight-year-old Yaroslav Hunka, who fought for the First Ukrainian Division under Nazi command, drew a standing ovation from Canadian lawmakers and a grinning Zelenskyy raised his fist in acknowledgment.Russia pouncedon the incident; the Kremlin has long claimed without evidence that Ukraine's government harbors Nazis. Canada's House of Commonsspeaker resignedlast Tuesday for inviting Hunka, whom he had introduced as a Ukrainian and Canadian ""hero."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau later made apublic apology. Russiapopped up againin the second Republican presidential primary debateon Wednesday. Candidate Nikki Haley said ""a win for Russia is a win for China."" And candidate Chris Christie said of Russian President Vladimir Putin, ""If we give him any of Ukraine, next will be Poland."" The Ukraine war was a sticking pointin the first Republican primary debate in August. Former President Donald Trump sat out both debates. U.S. Congressdropped aid for Ukrainein a stopgap spending measureto temporarily fund the federal government until Nov. 17. The government had been headed for a shutdown if Congress could not approve a new spending bill. On Saturday, the House approved a bill that left out about $6 billion for Ukraine that had approval in the Senate. A party led bya pro-Russian figurewon the most votes in Slovakia's parliamentary elections, which could shift policies in a country that's a member of NATO and the European Union. It could also bring back to office former Prime Minister Robert Fico, whowants to cut military supportto Ukraine and instead seek a deal for Russia and Ukraine to end the war.

The MRS Operations Award recognises the operations professionals who are fundamental to keeping the research and insight sector running. The winners were announced on 28.09.2023. Having a strong record of providing support to academics all over the world with their research studies, Bilendi has been involved in the TISP-Project since the beginning of 2023. TISP is a huge multi-country research project running in 68 countries in partnership with respected researchers fromHarvard Universityand theUniversity of Zurich. Multi-country research project covering 68 countries and 79% of the global population What are the underlying reasons behind the erosion of trust in science, the prevalence and correlates of science-related populist attitudes across countries, and the consequences of this declining trust? To answer these questions, Dr. Viktoria Cologna (Harvard University) and Dr. Niels G. Mede (University of Zurich) envisioned the TISP project. The project adopted a Many Labs format, bringing together an interdisciplinary team of 240 scientists from 68 countries. The baseline survey engaged over 70,000 respondents across 68 countries, spanning all inhabited continents. Consequently, the survey encompassed 31% of the world's countries, representing a remarkable 79% of the global population. Country-specific approach and strong quality control measures Data collection occurred from November 2022 to April 2023. Samples were carefully weighted to reflect national distributions of age, gender, education level, and country size. Due to the project's global scope, data collection methods were tailored accordingly. In countries with limited internet penetration, the questionnaires were adapted to a face-to-face data collection with Computer Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI). In some markets, country-specific questions were added, for example on the response of local governments to COVID-19 and the impacts of the pandemic on people's lives. Bilendi, provided advice on questionnaire adaptation considering country-specific legislation, language, and topic-sensitiveness, demonstrating a commitment to ethical and responsible research practices. Page 1/3 Bilendi maintained strong quality control measures throughout fieldwork and data processing to ensure reliable data integrity. Alongside the usual thorough quality checks, a dedicated Quality Assurance Team worked with TISP project leads to conduct meticulous manual quality controls. This unwavering commitment resulted in accurate research outcomes with minimal data cleaning required in all markets. High-quality standards, academic experience and international project management capabilities were key factors for choosing Bilendi as the main data collection provider. According to the TISP Project Leads, ""Bilendi was particularly suited to the project due to its professionalism, high-quality standards, academic experience, and international project management capabilities"". As part of its ISO certification, Bilendi meticulously assessed and vetted 50 distinct local providers. Bilendi assembled a team of 14 Senior Project Managers located in numerous countries to support the 69 collaborator groups. This dedicated TISP Project Management Team successfully oversaw 79 individual projects, spanning 68 countries in 18 time zones and involving 35 languages. Dr. Viktoria Cologna, main lead of the TISP Project (Harvard University, USA), states: ""Thanks to their global coverage, Bilendi helped us to collect samples across all inhabited continents, providing guidance and instruction to our global team whenever needed. The best part about working with Bilendi was the open and transparent communication with both the project managers assisting our collaborators and the executive team who oversaw the entire project. Bilendi was always open to feedback and willing to accommodate our requests expeditiously. After our successful collaboration on TISP, I am already working with Bilendi on a new project and have also recommended Bilendi to several other colleagues interested in recruiting global samples."" Marc Bidou, CEO and founder of Bilendi, states: ""We are extremely proud to have been awarded with a highly commended award for the best data collection solution of the year for quantitative research. This award recognizes the work carried out by all our teams, whom I warmly congratulate on their commitment. I would like to thank Harvard University and the University of Zurich for the confidence they have shown in us by entrusting us with this ambitious global project.

Slovakia has accused Moscow of interfering in itsparliamentary electionsand summoned a Russian embassy official to protest statements by Moscow’s foreign intelligence service director, Sergey Naryshkin. Slovakia’s Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs said on Monday that it summoned a Russian embassy representative who spoke about “interference” by the United States in the country, an accusation the ministry called false. It said the comments were made on the eve of the Slovak parliamentary elections on Saturday when a moratorium on information that may benefit or harm candidates was in place. “The department of diplomacy strongly protests against the false statement of Russian intelligence which cast doubt on the integrity of the free and democratic election in Slovakia,” the ministry said. “We consider such deliberately spread of disinformation to be unacceptable interference by the Russian Federation in the election process.” It called on Russia to cease all disinformation activities aimed at Slovakia. The Russian embassy in Slovakia rejected the allegations. “Unlike some of Slovakia’s current allies, we do not interfere with internal affairs of other countries, we do not take part in regime changes and various ‘colour’ revolutions,” it said on Facebook.      Slovakia’s president on Monday asked the leader of the winning party to try to form a coalition government. Populist former Prime Minister Robert Fico and his leftist Smer, or Direction, party captured 22.9 percent of the vote on Saturday. It will have 42 seats in the 150-seat parliament. If he succeeds in forming a coalition government, Fico, 59, will become prime minister for the fourth time. Fico campaigned on apro-Russian and anti-American message, has pledged to end Slovakmilitary support for Ukraineand opposes sanctions on Russia. In a televised address to the nation on Monday, President Zuzana Caputova stressed that the new government would have to be “a government which will serve all citizens”.

To date, 5,523 exoplanets have been confirmed in 4,117 systems, with another 9,867 candidates awaiting confirmation. With all these planets available for study, exoplanet researchers have been shifting their focus from detection to characterization—i.e., looking for potential signs of life and biological activity (biosignatures).Some major breakthroughs are expected in the coming years, thanks in part to next-generation observatories like NASA's James Webb and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and the ESA's PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission.Several ground-based facilities will also be vital to the characterization of exoplanets, like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), and the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). But there are also existing observatories that could be upgraded to perform vitalexoplanetresearch.This idea was explored in a recent paper by an international team of astronomers, who presented the first light results of the High-Resolution Imaging and Spectroscopy of Exoplanets (HiRISE) recently installed on the ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT)—not to be confused with the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).The study was led by Dr. Arthur Vigan, a permanent researcher with the Centre Nationale Reserches Scientifique based at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille. He was joined by researchers from the European Southern Observatory (ESO), the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), the Academia Sinica, the Ecole Normale Supérieure, the UH Institue for Astronomy, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), and multiple universities and laboratories. Apreprint of their paperrecently appeared online and is being reviewed for publication by the journalAstronomy & Astrophysics.Exoplanet research has been moving into characterization thanks to improvements in instrumentation and machine learning. With such a large sample of planets, scientists are now characterizing individual planet atmospheres and can draw statistical conclusions on large samples. These improvements are also leading to a transition in terms of methods, where exoplanets are being studied using direct imaging more than ever before. This method consists of detecting exoplanets by imaging the light reflected from their atmospheres and surfaces.This stands in contrast to indirect methods like transit photometry or Doppler spectroscopy (aka thetransit methodandradial velocity method), which have been responsible for the majority of exoplanet detections and confirmations so far. A major benefit of direct imaging is that astronomers can examine the reflected light using spectrometers to determine the chemical composition of an exoplanet's atmosphere. Said Dr. Vigan via email:""Detection of these objects and measuring accurate spectra is still quite challenging because they are typically at extremely small angular separation from their host star and with a huge difference in brightness. A classical analogy is that of trying to image a candle located 1 m apart from a lighthouse when you observe from 700 km away! In the field of direct imaging, the combination of high-contrast imaging, which enables the detection of these planets, with high-resolution spectroscopy is a really hot topic right now. This is exactly what HiRISE enables on the VLT.""ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) has captured an unprecedented series of images showing the passage of the exoplanet Beta Pictoris b around its parent star. Credit: ESOThe HiRISE instrument is designed to characterize extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) in the infrared H band, an atmospheric transmission window astronomers use to measure the absorption by water vapor, volcanic activity, and other atmospheric phenomena. It combines the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) imager with the recently upgraded high-resolution CRyogenic high-resolution InfraRed Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES) using single-mode optic fibers. The addition of this instrument will greatly enhance the VLT's imaging capabilities, which are currently limited in terms of spectral resolution relative to other observatories.This is particularly the case for SPHERE, said Dr. Vigan, which is dedicated to finding exoplanets via direct imaging but has a maximum resolution of just ~70. ""Other instruments like SINFONI (retired) or now ERIS provide higher resolutions, but they are not really optimized for exoplanet imaging, and GRAVITY provided some great results with interferometry, but except in a few cases, it is limited to a resolution of a few hundred,"" he said. ""By contrast, HiRISE enables a resolution of 100,000! This opens the door to much more detailed spectral characterization and to measuring dynamical parameters such as the speed at which these planets orbit around their star and how fast they spin.""In addition to atmospheric characterization, these measurements will help astronomers investigate EGP formation, composition, and evolution, addressing some significant mysteries and helping astronomers refine their models for solar system formation. Based on the first light collected using the new HiRISE instrument, the team demonstrated how its incorporation into the VLT has led to improved astrometry, temporal stability, optical aberrations, and transmission. Moreover, their paper demonstrates how existing instruments and observatories can be upgraded to provide high-contrast imaging or high-dispersion spectroscopy by coupling them using optical fibers.This offers a cost-effective alternative to creating entirely new facilities from the ground up, which is the case with the ELT, GMT, and TMT. As these examples have demonstrated, the creation of new facilities is expensive, subject to delays, and can generate controversy when it comes to where facilities are being built (sensitive ecosystems, protected environments, Indigenous land, etc.). As Dr. Vigan explained:""Designing, manufacturing, testing, and installing a brand new instrument on a large ground-based telescope is both long and costly: 10 years and ~20 million euros (including 10 million in hardware) for the SPHERE instrument on the VLT. This is even without taking into account that you need an available focus on the telescope for the new instrument. The advantage of coupling existing instruments is that you can go much faster and much cheaper while still making a great instrument that benefits from existing ones.""In the case of HiRISE, he added, it took about five years of development and cost around €1 million ($1.16 million), including €200,000 to pay for the hardware and labor costs. In contrast, the European Southern Observatory placed the cost of building the ELT at $1.5 billion in 2020 (€1.42 billion). This was after the ESO approved a budget increase of 10%, and the facility will not be completed for several more years. Meanwhile, Dr. Vigan and the ESO hope to commence observations with the upgraded VLT by November, which will serve as a pathfinder for other observatories:""Hopefully, HiRISE will pave the way for future instruments, for example on the extremely large telescopes (ELTs). We have learned a lot while designing the instrument and we will now investigate its limits. The European ELT built by ESO will at some point have an exoplanet imaging instrument aiming at the detection of Earth analogs around nearby stars. It's already foreseen that the instrument will include a high-resolution spectroscopy mode to help boost the detection. Everything we have done and learned with HiRISE will be a great starting point.""",en

Bilendi awarded by the Market Research Society for its worldwide research project with Harvard and Zurich Universities   Paris, October 2nd, 2023- Bilendi was awarded with a highly commended award for the best data collection solution of the year for quantitative research given by the British Market Research Society, for the project “Trust in Science and Science-related Populism” (TISP). The MRS Operations Award recognises the operations professionals who are fundamental to keeping the research and insight sector running. The winners were announced on 28.09.2023.  Having a strong record of providing support to academics all over the world with their research studies, Bilendi has been involved in the TISP-Project since the beginning of 2023. TISP is a huge multi-country research project running in 68 countries in partnership with respected researchers fromHarvard Universityand theUniversity of Zurich.   Multi-country research project covering 68 countries and 79% of the global population  What are the underlying reasons behind the erosion of trust in science, the prevalence and correlates of science-related populist attitudes across countries, and the consequences of this declining trust? To answer these questions, Dr. Viktoria Cologna (Harvard University) and Dr. Niels G. Mede (University of Zurich) envisioned the TISP project. The project adopted a Many Labs format, bringing together an interdisciplinary team of 240 scientists from 68 countries. The baseline survey engaged over 70,000 respondents across 68 countries, spanning all inhabited continents. Consequently, the survey encompassed 31% of the world's countries, representing a remarkable 79% of the global population.   Country-specific approach and strong quality control measures  Data collection occurred from November 2022 to April 2023. Samples were carefully weighted to reflect national distributions of age, gender, education level, and country size. Due to the project's global scope, data collection methods were tailored accordingly. In countries with limited internet penetration, the questionnaires were adapted to a face-to-face data collection with Computer Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI). In some markets, country-specific questions were added, for example on the response of local governments to COVID-19 and the impacts of the pandemic on people’s lives. Bilendi, provided advice on questionnaire adaptation considering country-specific legislation, language, and topic-sensitiveness, demonstrating a commitment to ethical and responsible research practices. Bilendi maintained strong quality control measures throughout fieldwork and data processing to ensure reliable data integrity. Alongside the usual thorough quality checks, a dedicated Quality Assurance Team worked with TISP project leads to conduct meticulous manual quality controls. This unwavering commitment resulted in accurate research outcomes with minimal data cleaning required in all markets.  High-quality standards, academic experience and international project management capabilities were key factors for choosing Bilendi as the main data collection provider.  According to the TISP Project Leads, “Bilendi was particularly suited to the project due to its professionalism, high-quality standards, academic experience, and international project management capabilities”. As part of its ISO certification, Bilendi meticulously assessed and vetted 50 distinct local providers. Bilendi assembled a team of 14 Senior Project Managers located in numerous countries to support the 69 collaborator groups. This dedicated TISP Project Management Team successfully oversaw 79 individual projects, spanning 68 countries in 18 time zones and involving 35 languages.   Dr. Viktoria Cologna, main lead of the TISP Project (Harvard University, USA), states: “Thanks to their global coverage, Bilendi helped us to collect samples across all inhabited continents, providing guidance and instruction to our global team whenever needed. The best part about working with Bilendi was the open and transparent communication with both the project managers assisting our collaborators and the executive team who oversaw the entire project. Bilendi was always open to feedback and willing to accommodate our requests expeditiously. After our successful collaboration on TISP, I am already working with Bilendi on a new project and have also recommended Bilendi to several other colleagues interested in recruiting global samples.”  Marc Bidou, CEO and founder of Bilendi, states: “We are extremely proud to have been awarded with a highly commended award for the best data collection solution of the year for quantitative research. This award recognizes the work carried out by all our teams, whom I warmly congratulate on their commitment. I would like to thank Harvard University and the University of Zurich for the confidence they have shown in us by entrusting us with this ambitious global project. The great success of this project confirms our position as one of the few players capable of carrying out projects on a global scale.”  Next publication: Q3 2023 sales: November 8, 2023 (after market close)  About Bilendi At a time when the volume, variety and speed of data transmitted and exchanged are increasing exponentially, Bilendi provides an innovative technological response to data collection, management and enhancement.

[+] Images) Mexico's top two political parties selected female presidential nominees, virtually ensuring that the nation's next leader will be a woman. It will be a historic first for the country, which has established itself as a global leader in promoting gender equality in government. Mexico’s ruling party selected Claudia Sheinbaum as its candidate. Sheinbaum served as the Mayor of Mexico City and is a protégé of Mexico’s current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. In the June 2, 2024 election, she will face off against the opposition candidate, engineer and tech entrepreneur Xóchitl Gálvez. Although other candidates will appear on the ballot, the victor is expected to be either Sheinbaum or Gálvez. The rise of women in political power in Mexico can be attributed to years of increasingly stringent quotas for women in government positions. These efforts culminated in a bold 2019 constitutional reform called “gender parity in everything.” This legislation required that political parties put forward equal numbers of male and female candidates for congressional seats, governorships, municipal government positions and even the Supreme Court. As a result of the legislation, Mexico has become a trailblazer in gender equity in politics. “I think they really have positioned themselves as a global leader on this issue,” says Jennifer Piscopo, a professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London. “In Latin America, Bolivia and Ecuador have similar constitutional and electoral statutes in place that would allow them to do what Mexico is doing, but they haven't had the strong implementation that Mexico has,” she adds. It all started in 1996 when Mexican lawmakers recommended that women make up 30% of all congressional candidates. In 2002, this recommendation became law, and by 2008, the quota was raised to 40% female representation. In 2014, the percentage was increased once more to 50%. The 2019 “gender parity in everything” constitution reform expanded the 50% quota to include the executive, legislative and judicial branches. These quotas have been a game-changer in transforming women’s access to political power in Mexico. Female congressional representation climbed from 15% in 1994 to 50% in 2023, and many states now have female governors for the first time. The 11-justice Supreme Court now includes four women and a female chief justice. In total, Mexico ranks fourth when it comes to female representation in parliaments throughout the world. By comparison, the United States is not close to achieving gender parity and occupies the 70th position in rankings of female representation in national parliaments. In the U.S., only 25% of senators and 28.8% of representatives are women. Unfortunately, implementing a quota like their southern neighbors would be difficult. In the U.S., political candidates select their party without party control, which makes it nearly impossible to restrict political parties’ nominees with quotas. Although the U.S. political system makes implementing the quota systems challenging, there are still avenues for getting more women involved in politics. For example, Piscopo says that the parties can still recruit more women. “They [parties] play an important role in support, choosing which candidates they're going to finance and choosing which candidates they're going to campaign for,” she says. This process could evolve to cultivate a more diverse set of candidates. In addition, the U.S. Federal Electoral Commission implemented a change allowing candidates to use campaign donations to fund childcare costs that result from time spent running for office. “Things like that are huge for women,” Piscopo explains. As for the upcoming presidential election in Mexico, candidate Gálvez believes ovaries are what’s needed to fight the organized crime and drug cartels that contribute to the violence in the country. ""Enough already! Ovaries are needed to punish those who break the law,"" Gálvez wrote on Instagram. Time will tell if ovaries hold the solution to Mexico’s problems.",en
